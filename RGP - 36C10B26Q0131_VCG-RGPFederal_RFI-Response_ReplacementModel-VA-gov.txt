A VA.gov Modernization that Honors the Stakes
Executive Summary.
Modernizing VA.gov is a continuity preserving evolution; not a rebuild. Veterans Affairs (VA) can improve experience, identity, content, and platform capabilities without interrupting access to care, benefits, claims, prescriptions, or secure communications. This approach has the secret sauce that delivers incremental, composable modernization guided by Veterancentered design, strong governance, and measurement.
We Know Veterans Affairs.
VA.gov is so much more than just another website; it's a lifeline for Veterans and the central access point for high-volume, high-stakes services across benefits, healthcare, and support. RGP understands replacing VA.gov is much more than a technical rebuild, but also a holistic modernization effort that must balance secure, scalable platform capabilities with a deeply human-centered experience. Through years of partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs on digital modernization, content strategy, and human-centered design initiatives, we have gained firsthand insight into how Veterans navigate digital services and how critical accessibility, trust, and clarity are to their experience.
Our work within VA's ecosystem has also given us an understanding of the operational and technical constraints, from VAEC GovCloud and stringent security/privacy requirements to complex integrations across EVSS, VBMS, MHV, Caseflow, VA Profile, and evolving Login.gov/ID.me identity flows. We recognize delivering a best-in-class digital experience requires alignment across design, technology, operations, and program offices. A continuity-first, experience-led approach will help the VA confidently modernize while honoring the realities of its mission and environment.
An Evolving VA.GOV That Protects Veterans.
The successful future of VA.gov will not be defined by a single redesign or a major system replacement. It will be a steady, confident evolution of strategy, operations and engineering that preserves trust for every Veteran every day. In this future state, VA.gov becomes a calm, intuitive, dependable service companion that adapts to Veterans' needs while modernizing safely behind the scenes. The details of implementation look different depending on the circumstances but follow these common guiding principles:
Let the experience lead. This goes for both Veterans and service providers and it starts with understanding the real problems each user group is facing. Armed with this understanding, we can define the desired future state.
Enable technology evolution. To support an ever-changing digital environment,

technology must be adaptable. The ideal technology ecosystem is composable and decoupled from specific tools to allow for changes without requiring full re-platforming.
Make governance intentional. The best digital experiences are governed by standards, processes and guardrails that enable accelerated portfolio delivery and ensure maintenance over time.
Measure to guide incremental improvements. Measured outcomes steer future upgrades and ensure your time and resources are spent on efforts that bring the best outcomes.
What might the future state look like for Veterans? The following scenarios aren't hypotheticals. They reflect patterns we've already seen work across VA programs and elsewhere. They grow directly out of lessons learned from real initiatives that have improved clarity, connection, and continuity for a wide variety of users. This is how we can apply those same principles to a VA.gov modernization.
Morning Clarity: "Show Me What Matters Today".
James, a 42-year-old Army Veteran and father of two, will soon begin his morning commute. He has a question about one of his healthcare benefits, so before he leaves for work, he goes to VA.gov to find the answer. He notices a new AI search feature has been added to the site. He types his question into the search field and VA.gov surfaces the right information, giving him quick clarity that eases the stress of a day full of competing demands. By starting with AI powered search, James found a faster path to content beyond what traditional site navigation could offer.
AI search is a singular improvement that can make a big impact in a variety of different ways. Using information already on the site, natural language processes models interpret search queries and recommend results. Summarized search results in common language and accompanied by links help James navigate directly where he needs to go without ever clicking a navigation menu.
Over time, incremental improvements can be made using this AI tool to improve Jame's experience even more. When James signs in to VA.gov again, he not only has access to AI search, but now he sees a personalized "Today View" that brings together his most

important information:
§ Details for an upcoming physical therapy appointment § Dosage and refill reminders, for his prescriptions § Update about his education benefits § Previews and direct link to his secure messages
Through our work with the Office of Connected Care, we introduced experience patterns that aggregate cross-product signals (appointments, medication refills, and secure messages) into simplified, Veteran-facing views. Similarly, our leadership of VA Profile / Master Data Management unified fragmented data sources, enabling millions of accurate, real-time updates to flow into digital touchpoints. These capabilities directly support the foundation of James's future "Today View" and incremental improvements could be made to enable AIenhanced search to surface the right information instantly, reducing dependence on navigation menus and eliminating guesswork. See Appendix pages A-21 and A-22 for more information.
One Seamless Path to Benefits: "Online or In-person, it's the Same Experience".
Theresa, a 34-year-old Marine Corps Veteran, is ready to apply for her benefits. The process is now standardized for both the online and in-person experience, and the traditional long forms are replaced with step-by-step incremental data entry.
1. She begins the process of creating an account using ID.me/Login.gov.
2. Once she has an account, the personalization AI sees she has not applied for benefits and prompts her to do so. The experience walks her through step-by-step.
3. If she gets stuck, an AI chatbot (supported by the same or similar algorithm used for AI search) offers to chat and provides links to helpful information. She never feels locked out, confused, or out of control.
4. On the backend, the platform enables Theresa to complete her service applications in multiple sessions by saving her progress at regular intervals.
5. Using the existing VA Profile (or something similar), the information she enters can also be shared with multiple VA service providers so she does not need to fill out multiple applications.
6. Once she's applied, she logs in to a personalized space where she can see the status of her application and view other information that helps her know what to do next.

Our work on past VA modernization efforts, including support across Veteran, caregiver, beneficiary personas for impactful journeys such as:

§ applying for live pension benefits § service-related disability application § survivors pension/compensation § health care enrollment

§ finding a home § looking for a job § scheduling a burial and memorial

We have replaced monolithic, multipage applications with guided, stepwise journeys that preserved progress and reduced abandonment. We also introduced assisted-support patterns across the Veteran Community Care journey. These same design and workflow principles power Theresa's seamless application experience. See Appendix pages A-24, A-26, A-27, and A-28 for more information.

A Clear, Supported Content Ecosystem: "Make Providing the Best Experience Easy".
Linda, a 54-year-old VA employee, has worked for Veterans Affairs for more than a decade. She knows all the tips and tricks that help veterans be successful and does her best to share that information on VA.gov via articles, forums and chat support. She is now able to manage her content with a clear model that distinguishes different types of content, keeps track of versions and history and help ensure the right stuff is published to the right groups at the right time using their simplified content technology ecosystem. Modern content management ensures information is correct, consistent, and automatically updated everywhere it appears. Content becomes an engine of clarity rather than confusion for both Veterans and those providing services.

The final pieces of the puzzle are the new features Linda has access to that transform how she creates and publishes content across channels like website and mobile apps. Templates are created that support how the AI algorithm interprets content which makes content faster to publish and easier to update. The content management software reminds Linda when content needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure the best search results are always being provided. It also provides a clear process for retiring out-of-date content as to not bog down search results.

In our work at Performance Food Group and many other clients, we developed modular content types, lifecycle governance, and authoring workflows that ensure canonical information is accurate and automatically distributed across channels. By establishing version control, automated review reminders, and content dependencies, we enabled

teams--like Linda's--to manage large, complex content estates with clarity and confidence. See Appendix pages A-25, A-26, A-30 for more information.
How To Accomplish This Vision.
Across all these stories, the most powerful part of the future VA.gov is not any single feature, but the steady consistent improvements that build an intelligent content ecosystem focused on improving the experience for all user groups overtime. An intelligent content ecosystem considers all parts of a content supply chain (strategy, operations, and engineering) and makes them work together toward a singularly focused goal. Accounting for the rippling effect a change to one area has on the other two is the secret recipe for success that many organizations miss in their modernizations.
Strategy Guides Meaningful Modernization.
Effective content ecosystems emerge from clear messaging strategy and a well-defined content strategy. Most organizations have at least a basic messaging strategy, meaning they understand the types of information they want to communicate to certain audiences. However, content strategy is often a significant blind spot that requires understanding the experience and needs of the users, the types of content they use, the channels they frequent, how they interact with content on those channels to overcome. Aligning those things to best meet the goals of the organization creates a strong strategy that serves as the foundation for a cohesive future-state experience and informs operational and engineering decisions.
Every organization approaches these complex problems somewhat differently, but successful strategies are based on user experience research, content and channel assessments, persona development, user journey mapping, and other human-centered insights. The information defined by these activities is directive but works in conjunction with operations and engineering to create the user experience and the foundation of the content ecosystem. Although strategy development can feel overwhelming, the process can be efficiently completed when supported by the right internal stakeholders. And in the case of Veterans Affairs, much of this groundwork has already been explored through related initiatives--giving you a strong head start.
Operations Sustain and Enable Delivery.
Strategy defines a vision for an ideal future state void of limitations. Operations (and engineering) keep that future state safely tethered to reality. Operations focus primarily on the processes that support the end-user experience throughout the content lifecycle and the people who execute and/or support those processes. Operations look different in every organization, each with their own limitations and tradeoffs, but the best operational models to have some common elements:
Service Design Mindset. Organizations that design operations in service to the strategy and keep that as a guiding principle in all decision-making get the best outcomes. Developing a service design mindset involves activities like service blueprinting, process mapping and content organization design to bring processes and people into alignment.
Embedded Standards and Controls. An ecosystem that isn't governed will not be maintained. Embedding standards and controls into processes and systems is an
© 2026 Resources Connection, Inc. Confidential | rgpfederal.com | 6

15950 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 330 Dallas, TX 75248 (+1) 214.777.0600
essential ingredient to success that many organizations address as an afterthought. Creating meaningful standards can be part of creating the strategy, but operations is where policy and process are established that support their enforcement. This includes things like program and product management, technology managed workflows and procedural guardrails.
Intentional Change Management. Changes to other areas of the content ecosystem almost always mean operational changes as well. Organizations that intentionally plan change management as part of implementation get faster more complete behavioral alignment from employees. Meaningful change management involves more than just communications and training.
Content operations at the VA are complex. A range of workflows for publishing content and content teams are spread throughout an org structure where content operations standards unenforced, highly varied, or non-existent. Simplifying these processes and structures and embedding standards and governance will be critical to establishing better operational practices and maintaining them overtime. This will require behavioral change from employees, but this is manageable with intentional change management practices embedded into the newly established ecosystem.
Engineering Builds the Modern Content Foundation.
Content engineering is primarily completed within the technology, systems, and platforms themselves, but it also includes some process and people considerations specific to ensuring solutions align with the strategy and are supported and maintained overtime.
Content technology ecosystems evolve in complexity over time due to changing priorities and needs. Often, technology limitations are the primary factor dictating the user experience. This situation is stifling and falls short of meeting user needs. To avoid this, modern technology solution designs are componentized and modular to increase their flexibility and adaptability.
We believe Veterans Affairs is having similar challenges with a decoupled content management architecture that facilitates parallel teams implementing a wide range of capabilities. This decoupling allows the VA to separate content management from application code, eliminates a real time production CMS, and promotes the separation of concerns between teams. The paradigm is sound, but it has inadvertently led to a dual-track frontend architecture:
§ Track one contains React components with hard-coded content invoking a Ruby on Rails service layer.
§ Track two contains liquid templates, YAML, and markdown files rendered at build time from the content in Drupal.
These dual tracks have created inconsistent content operations, confusing authoring workflows, and tight couplings between components. In addition to creating issues for operations and engineering, these things can also stagnate the user experience as the VA must spend more resources on technology and operations than experience improvement.
A decoupled headless content management system is the modern solution to many content

15950 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 330 Dallas, TX 75248 (+1) 214.777.0600
woes. It serves as the single source of truth which is critical for enabling seamless and efficient operations across multiple existing channels (websites, mobile apps, chatbots, AI systems) as well as any future platforms. Additionally, a decoupled architecture dramatically accelerates development as teams can build new experiences by simply connecting to existing content APIs, eliminating the need to recreate or duplicate content for each channel. Launching new applications becomes straightforward: developers tap into the same content repository while building channel-specific experiences and updates made once in the CMS instantly propagate across all touchpoints. It's an engineering solution that provides the most flexibility for strategic and operational change while still providing high-quality service.
Platform Modernization Without Disruption.
Not all technology problems require a complete re-platform. The headless CMS approach would build upon the solid architectural principles already in place on VA.gov and unlock the full potential of a content management system. VA.gov would become a single, composable, API-driven content platform that continues to power the existing React applications and use existing service layers. This would reduce development friction caused by tight couplings and competing paradigms and increase development and operational efficiency without the disruption of a "big bang" re-platform.
Moving toward an architecture that fully embraces the headless and composable paradigm is possible with technologies employed on VA.gov today. React is currently used as the primary technology in the experience layer, and its component-first architecture is ideal toward this end. However, to fully leverage the power of a headless CMS there are patterns that should be followed:
Establishing a single approach to pull content from the CMS is critical. A strength of composable architecture is it facilitates using any technology to consume content from a central repository. While VA.gov is comprised of multiple React applications, it is a single user experience. As such, using consistent technology would maximize the portability of components and reduce duplicative functionality. Embracing JSX over Liquid templates would be a solid step toward this consistency.
Refactoring existing React components to exclude hard-coded content. Content residing in a codebase presents multiple challenges. Operationally, changes to content require developer intervention disrupting delivery cycles. Content cannot easily be used across channels as it can housed in a CMS. Furthermore, providing multi-lingual experiences to users becomes more challenging.
While we see moving content from application code to the CMS as an essential step from a technical perspective, it also provides the opportunity to revisit how the content is structured. Intentional content modeling practices help ensure optimization not only today, but also when new features and cross-channel delivery happen in the future. Focusing on reusability instead of organizing content by page, establishing clear content hierarchies, including metadata for each content type, and favoring structured content over rich text are all examples of content modeling activities that could help.
Once content is in order, the content structure makes clear how to optimize the build and deployment of the React application. For example, for pages that change infrequently,

(+1) 214.777.0600
using static generation (SSG) served from a CDN can increase performance, while pages requiring authentication or containing personalized user content would benefit from server side-rendering (SSR). To create a maximally scalable foundation, configuring incremental builds and/or on-demand page generation is the best solution. This approach supports a scalable and extensible site that will easily handle spikes in usage.
Guided by principles of continuity-first, the headless CMS approach incrementally decouples Drupal dependencies where needed, introduces a single supported content layer, and removes content from the React codebase. Capabilities can evolve without platform lock-in, and clear standards and reusable design patterns can be used to accelerate delivery across teams with security, privacy, and accessibility embedded at every layer. Every release becomes an opportunity to advance the Veteran experience-- offering gentle transitions, empathetic content, and a coherent journey powered by a modern, composable architecture that can grow with VA's mission for decades to come.
Decouple identity providers and inject tiered identity proofing. Decoupling the id.me and login.gov identity providers from VA.gov reduces friction for both users and development teams. By introducing a third-party SSOe solution, the implementation of managing each provider workflow is abstracted away from VA.gov. This ensures a smoother login, MFA, and identity verification process. Another way to reduce friction is to reduce the identity proofing process for VA.gov users that have a relationship with Veteran that either receive benefits or are responsible for Veteran care. By introducing a tiered identity proofing process that leverages a subset of MPI data stored in VA Profile, users can access areas of VA.gov based on their tier. This allows more users to make use of VA.gov and provides immediate access reducing support call volume and foot traffic into VA medical centers.
Reducing Friction, Enabling Innovation.
Following architectural best practices fundamentally shifts where development teams spend their time. Decoupling content from consuming channels and building frontends with scalable patterns results in a technical foundation that supports rapid change rather than resisting it. By removing technical friction and redirecting energy toward innovation, teams can focus on high-value outcomes like the AI-enabled search referenced in the scenarios.
Implementing an AI-driven search solution starts with defining the searchable content. We then convert it into embeddings, a format that captures meaning and concepts. These embeddings are stored in a vector database (like Pinecone or Supabase). When a Veteran enters a query, the system finds the most relevant benefits from your curated content and sends them to an LLM which generates a conversational answer tailored to their situation. The Veteran gets a helpful, plain-language responses that guide them directly to the right benefits and enrollment pages.
Other opportunities for innovative and high-value outcomes for Veterans may not come with as many caveats. The AI-driven personal to-do list referenced in the scenarios above is an example. Such a solution would consist of fetching contextual information about the loggedin user using data from the identity provider and the Ruby on Rails service layer. This data would then be fed through a rules engine (custom business logic) for determining eligibility, sequencing and prioritization of workflow actions. These results would then be provided to an LLM which generates a personalized greeting and summary of next steps. In this case the AI is

15950 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 330 Dallas, TX 75248 (+1) 214.777.0600
not changing the mechanics through which the user interacts with the system as it does in search but is being leveraged to add value by creating a personalized experience focused on helping Veterans to find what they need more efficiently.
Risks & Tradeoffs.
Risks and tradeoffs must be considered with any technical change. While we believe fully embracing a headless CMS as the core of a resilient content ecosystem that powers multiple channels will reduce operational friction and enable innovation, there are potential side effects to consider:
How the React applications consume data from the CMS. This is necessary to mitigate a tight coupling to specific data structures or vendor lock-in. A certain amount of this may be acceptable and can be managed through development standards. However, adding an abstraction layer between the CMS and content consumers that normalizes data into a consistent shape would help keep application code CMS-agnostic. While this approach allows full control of the data model, it does introduce another layer to maintain and debug. A pragmatic approach is to be intentional about any coupling and ensure it is isolated rather than permeating the entire codebase.
How user experience changes impact different sets of users. While chat-based interfaces and LLMs may be considered ubiquitous, such an experience may feel novel to some users of VA.gov. The intended purpose of this feature is akin to the fundamental principles of web accessibility - removing barriers to entry. To that end, the feature cannot be considered a success if it enhances the experiences for some users while becoming a burden for others. Careful thought should be taken in the nuances of the experience with offramps provided for users who feel comfortable with a more traditional approach.
Lessons Learned.
RGP has implemented intelligent content ecosystem solutions for a wide variety of clients over the years. We know this works because we've seen it, but we have also learned some lessons along the way that are critical to success:
You must consider the whole ecosystem, not just the technology. People, processes, and strategy are critical to headless CMS projects (and content projects in general). An architecture can be technically sound, but if content teams find the system difficult to use, or if stakeholders don't understand the underlying value, the effort falls apart. Organizational readiness is key to support this transition through establishing processes and delineating of content ownership.
Content editing and preview experiences must be frictionless. The people using the system to create experiences for Veterans should be empowered by the features and flexibility offered by a headless architecture. This can be achieved through ensuring robust preview functionality, inline editing where possible, clarity around required vs optional fields, and specifying character limits if necessary. Additionally, including content editors in the CMS selection process can support adoption.
Moving content uncovers hidden issues that must be addressed. More than copying data from one system to another, content migration can expose issues with the content itself, not just the technology. These issues are common and appear in almost every migration, but they must be addressed as they can heavily impact every area of the content ecosystem as well as project

budgets and timelines. Examples of these types of issues include things like removing out-of-date content, refactoring content structure, or addressing inconsistencies between existing content and new content models.
Conclusion.
Improvement without the overhaul is possible with an intelligent content ecosystem built on strong strategy, supportive operations and composable technology solutions that can adapt to the needs of the moment. By incrementally implementing a headless CMS in place of other less flexible alternatives, VA.gov can become the world-class experience Veterans deserve without disrupting services and experiences along the way. It's modernization that honors the stakes. We know this works because we have seen it in action. Included in the Appendix of this document in the following pages are an expanded sampling case studies with details on the solution, their implementation and how RGP supported the effort.

Imagine What is Possible for Veterans.
Imagine a VA.gov were Veterans see only what matters today--appointments, refills, claims, messages--in one Today View. Navigation is driven by "I want to..." instead of "Where does this live?" Identity friction disappears with progressive verification and reuse of known attributes. Status is clear, consistent, and always tells Veterans whether they need to act. Content is structured, current, and written in plain language. Teams across VA publish confidently due to strong governance and templates. Modernized experiences can launch without breaking continuity.

Identity Management that Meets the Moment.
VA.gov's future-state architecture introduces a composable, headless content platform that unifies content across all React components while preserving the site's high-performance static delivery model. An SSOe-based identity layer simplifies authentication and supports role-based, tiered identity proofing, ensuring the right level of verification for Veterans, spouses, and dependents. Enrollment becomes streamlined and adaptive, leveraging VA Profile's MPI-backed data to reduce friction and maintain consistent, authoritative identity records.

Consistency Across VA.
When present, complexity is the silent tax on everything content teams do. Streamlining convoluted systems simplifies the content supply chain, reducing friction, duplication, and the risk that things fall through the cracks. It also allows you to create better content models, reusable content types and clear content lifecycle governance. The result is a more scalable, resilient operation that can adapt as needs change, and bring real value to Veterans and their families without being held back by yesterday's tech and processes.
