1.0 Background
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates VA.gov as the primary digital entry point for Veterans, their families, caregivers, and partners seeking access to benefits, healthcare, and services. As recognized in the Request for Information (RFI), modernizing VA.gov is not solely a technical effort. It requires coordinated improvements across platform architecture, user experience, identity and access management, content governance, analytics, and operating models, all while maintaining uninterrupted service in a highly regulated, high-visibility federal environment.
This response outlines how modern, FedRAMP-aligned low-code platforms can support VA's modernization objectives by reducing architectural complexity, strengthening governance, and accelerating delivery without compromising security, accessibility, or compliance. Platforms that natively integrate identity management, data governance, accessibility controls, and scalable infrastructure enable phased, low-risk modernization approaches that emphasize coexistence and incremental transition rather than disruptive replacement.
The timing of VA.gov modernization is critical. Veteran expectations for secure, intuitive, and responsive digital services continue to rise, while the threat landscape has expanded to include sophisticated identity fraud and AI-enabled attacks. At the same time, federal mandates such as the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA Act) and Zero Trust security principles increase pressure to demonstrate measurable improvements in accessibility, resilience, and service quality. Continuing to extend highly customized, developer-intensive platforms compounds technical debt and operational risk over time.
The perspectives shared in this response are intended to inform VA's evaluation of potential paths forward by highlighting architectural patterns, operating model considerations, and lessons learned from regulated deployments. Rather than advocating a specific procurement outcome, this response provides practical insights to support planning, requirements development, and potential pilot efforts that balance innovation with stability, security, and long-term sustainability in service of Veterans and their families.

EDERA L3C'S RESPONSE TO NOTICE ID 365357
maintainability over unrestricted front-end customization. Highly bespoke visual designs or nonstandard rendering approaches may require additional configuration or complementary tooling. For VA.gov, this tradeoff reflects a deliberate balance between design flexibility and the need for consistent accessibility, security controls, and long-term sustainability across a complex enterprise environment.
Migration and continuity of service risk. Replacing VA.gov introduces inherent risk if executed as a single cutover event. Content, identity services, and application workflows must coexist across legacy and modern platforms during transition to avoid service disruption. Successful modernization depends on phased migration strategies, parallel operations, and clear criteria for decommissioning legacy components. Low-code platforms support this coexistence model, but outcomes depend on disciplined execution and governance rather than tooling alone.
Governance and operating model maturity. Low-code environments can accelerate delivery, but without clearly defined publishing authority, environment separation, and change management processes, they may introduce fragmentation or configuration drift. VA would need to establish role-based controls, release governance, and lifecycle ownership early in any modernization effort. Platform-native governance features can support these controls, but organizational alignment remains a critical success factor.
Identity integration and external dependencies. Integrations with identity proofing providers and enterprise identity services reduce authentication friction and improve security posture, but they also introduce external dependencies. Availability, incident response coordination, and service-level expectations must be addressed to ensure reliability during peak demand scenarios. Lessons learned from regulated deployments highlight the importance of redundancy planning, escalation paths, and continuous monitoring for identity services that support citizen-scale access.
Lessons learned from regulated deployments. Experience across federal and regulated environments indicates that the most successful modernization efforts share common characteristics: early definition of accessibility and design standards, explicit ownership of content and identity workflows, phased rollouts with measurable checkpoints, and close alignment between platform capabilities and enterprise compliance processes. Where these practices are absent, technology benefits alone are insufficient to mitigate risk.
