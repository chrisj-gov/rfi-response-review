1. Company or organization overview (name, location, and brief description of relevant capabilities).
OneGlobe LLC is a certified Small Business federal contractor headquartered in Reston, Virginia. OneGlobe supports civilian and defense agencies with digital platform modernization, cloudnative engineering, and human-centered delivery services in regulated environments.
At the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), DHS Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the United States Air Force (USAF), OneGlobe supports public-facing and mission-critical digital platforms that serve large, diverse user populations while operating under federal security, privacy, and accessibility mandates. These environments require coordination across enterprise platforms, shared services, and mission systems, and place sustained emphasis on availability, Section 508 accessibility compliance, information security controls, and public trust.
Our core capabilities include modern web application delivery, cloud platform engineering, identity-aware service integration, and operational sustainment. These capabilities are applied in environments that require continuous delivery, operational reliability, and alignment with agency governance and compliance constraints.
OneGlobe is a member of the One Phoenix Solution LLC joint venture, which holds the VA Secure, Performant, Reliable, and User-Centered Experiences (SPRUCE) contract vehicle. SPRUCE provides VA with a flexible mechanism to access digital platform modernization, discovery, and incremental delivery capabilities aligned with the scope described in this request, while allowing VA to evolve and adjust capacity and skills.
2. Relevant experience with similar challenges.
Relevant experience includes federal programs where digital platforms serve as the primary interface between users and complex, independently governed systems, similar in scale and coordination complexity to VA.gov. In these environments, delivery teams must balance usability, accessibility, and trust while operating under strict security, privacy, and operational constraints that limit the feasibility of disruptive platform change.
VA.gov represents a distinct class of federal digital platform that extends beyond a traditional information website. It functions simultaneously as a public-facing information site, a content management platform for policy-driven guidance, and an application delivery mechanism through which Veterans, family members, Veteran Service Organizations, and third parties authenticate and access benefits, health, and memorial services. Unlike standalone websites or single-purpose applications, VA.gov integrates with numerous independently deployed systems owned and operated by different program offices and released on independent timelines. As a result, the platform serves as an experience and trust layer that must provide continuity, clarity, and predictable behavior even as underlying applications evolve asynchronously.
Across DHS I&A, FEMA, and USAF programs, OneGlobe supported experience-layer platforms that coordinated user access, workflows, and information across independently owned systems rather than acting as systems of record. These environments required modernization approaches that accommodated asynchronous backend release cycles, program ownership boundaries, and differing operational priorities while preserving a consistent and predictable user experience.
In these environments, governance, alignment, and sequencing decisions shaped outcomes more than interface technology choices. Content ownership, eligibility logic, authorization rules, and application release cadences frequently resided with different organizations, requiring the experience layer to absorb change without introducing disruption or forcing backend convergence. Programs that treated platform evolution as a coordination and governance challenge, rather than a discrete technology replacement, were better positioned to sustain progress over time.

Additional experience includes platforms where continuity of service constrained modernization approaches. In FEMA disaster assistance, grants management, and USAF mission-support environments, users relied on consistent access to information and applications during timesensitive or mission-critical scenarios, including disaster response and recovery operations, benefits intake and adjudication periods, and operational mission planning. These conditions limited tolerance for disruptive transitions and reinforced the need for phased evolution, parallel operations, and clear rollback paths during platform change.
Human-centered design played a critical role across these efforts. Research with applicants, administrators, analysts, and operational staff examined how users interacted with complex platforms under stress, with limited connectivity, or with varying levels of digital literacy. Insights into friction points across content discovery, application access, and task completion informed sequencing decisions and transition strategies, reinforcing the need to align technical change with real user behavior and operational realities.
Taken together, this experience indicates that platform replacement initiatives are most effective when agencies explicitly account for the platform's role as an experience integrator, the independent evolution of underlying systems, and the need to sustain service throughout transition. These conditions closely mirror those associated with VA.gov and inform the market observations provided in the sections that follow. Figure 1 illustrates this experience-layer role as a mediating surface across independently governed systems, shown for conceptual context only.

3. Responses to the topics and questions in this request.
In environments where a single digital platform mediates access to dozens of statutory benefits and millions of users annually, replacement decisions carry institutional and trust implications beyond technology. Experience across federal programs indicates that outcomes are shaped as much by governance, ownership, and operating model decisions as by architectural or tooling choices. Clarity in these areas is also a primary driver of whether replacement efforts can be credibly scoped and estimated prior to solicitation.
The observations below reflect market patterns, risks, and lessons learned from comparable environments, and are intended to inform VA's consideration of replacement models, tradeoffs, and sequencing decisions.

3.1. Descriptions of relevant ideas, capabilities, and approaches.
In large federal platform modernization efforts, several recurring approaches are commonly observed, often combined or sequenced based on program assessment, governance constraints, and risk tolerance when agencies replace or substantially rework mission-critical digital platforms. These approaches reflect differing views on acceptable risk, continuity of service, and the degree of institutional change an organization is prepared to manage at one time.
One commonly observed pattern is incremental modernization of experience layers while existing backend systems remain authoritative. In this model, agencies focus first on user-facing workflows, navigation, and content presentation, allowing experience improvements to proceed without forcing immediate changes to complex or independently governed backend systems. This approach is often used where backend systems are stable, externally constrained, or governed by separate authorities, and where continuity of service is a primary concern.
A second pattern is the use of parallel-run replacement models, where a new platform is introduced alongside the existing one and traffic or functionality is gradually shifted over time. Agencies adopting this approach typically prioritize operational resilience and rollback capability, especially in environments supporting time-sensitive or high-visibility missions. Parallel operation allows testing of assumptions about scale, governance, and user behavior under real conditions, while avoiding a single cutover event that concentrates risk.
A third observed approach involves decoupling presentation and interaction layers from backend system evolution. In these cases, agencies treat the experience layer as a mediating surface that can integrate multiple backend systems with different lifecycles, data models, and governance structures. This pattern is often associated with environments where backend modernization is expected to occur over extended timelines, or where no single system of record can be rapidly replaced.
In practice, these approaches are rarely applied as isolated strategies. In several federal modernization efforts, agencies first conducted broad assessments across multiple programs to identify representative workflows and user communities, then applied a combination of experience-layer reengineering, parallel validation, and incremental expansion. This allowed core policy, workflow, and governance assumptions to be tested through an initial set of programs before extending the platform to additional use cases over time.
In addition to these structural approaches, some agencies are examining the use of AI-assisted experience layers to improve navigation, workflow guidance, and information retrieval across complex and fragmented system landscapes. These concepts are typically positioned as augmentations to the experience layer rather than replacements for backend systems or authoritative content sources. Their applicability depends on factors such as content ownership models, data quality and metadata consistency, governance over probabilistic responses, accessibility requirements, and tolerance for automated guidance in user-facing interactions. Such approaches depend on whether the platform is expected to deliver deterministic, reviewable outputs to the public, or whether limited use of probabilistic assistance is acceptable within clearly bounded user interactions. Absent clarity on these constraints, it is difficult for industry to assess whether AI-assisted navigation is feasible, appropriate, or in scope for a given platform modernization effort.
In DHS I&A, FEMA, and U.S. Air Force programs, the effectiveness of these approaches depended less on the specific technical patterns employed and more on how clearly agencies defined the problem being addressed, the scope of change under consideration, and the operational constraints that had to be maintained during transition. Where those factors were explicit, agencies were able to combine and sequence approaches deliberately. Absent clarity on VA's intended problem framing, desired outcomes, and acceptable tradeoffs, industry responses will necessarily rely on inferred assumptions, limiting the ability to assess approach viability or estimate effort with confidence.

3.2. Case studies or examples from similar environments.
In comparable federal environments, platform replacement efforts have often been constrained less by technical feasibility than by unresolved governance and ownership questions. In several cases, initiatives stalled when authority over content, policy interpretation, and experience-level decisions remained distributed across multiple organizations without a clear escalation or arbitration model. These efforts frequently underestimated the time and coordination required to align policy owners, content stewards, and system operators before meaningful platform change could occur.
Other programs encountered risk after underestimating the complexity of content-and policydriven workflows embedded in user-facing journeys. Changes that initially appeared to be navigational or presentation-focused surfaced downstream dependencies tied to eligibility interpretation, benefit-specific rules, review and approval cycles, and exception handling across multiple organizations. These dependencies were often only partially documented and required sustained coordination among policy owners, legal reviewers, content teams, and system operators to resolve, introducing delays not reflected in early replacement estimates.
In several environments, policy-driven experience changes required coordinated updates across multiple integrated systems, even when the originating change appeared localized. Adjustments to user-facing behavior frequently triggered cascading impacts to shared components, interfaces, or validation logic maintained by downstream application teams. These changes were not always aligned with the receiving systems' planned work, particularly when teams were executing critical fixes or externally imposed enhancements, audit remediation, statutory deadlines, or congressionally mandated updates that could not be deferred or resequenced. As a result, experience-level changes were delayed or partially implemented, despite being formally approved at the policy level. These conditions materially affect dependency assumptions, sequencing, and delivery risk that would need to be explicitly reflected in any RFQ to enable comparable proposals and credible estimation.
By contrast, programs that maintained continuity and forward progress typically adopted phased delivery models anchored in clear ownership at the experience layer and realistic sequencing of cross-system dependencies. In these cases, agencies established explicit decision authority for user-facing behavior, aligned policy-driven changes with system delivery cycles and system feature toggles, and treated dependency management as an ongoing delivery function rather than an exception process. This approach allowed platforms to evolve incrementally while preserving service continuity and institutional trust during transition.
3.3. User journey workflows for identity proofing, sign-in, recovery, and navigation.
User journey workflows in platforms like VA.gov extend beyond interface design and must be understood as cross-cutting operational experiences. Identity proofing serves as a trustestablishing event that informs eligibility, authorization, and downstream access across multiple services. Decisions about when proofing occurs, what assurance level is achieved, and how proofing outcomes are reused directly affect whether users can complete tasks without repeated friction or loss of access.
In complex, multi-system environments, early discipline in discovery and framing of all problem spaces directly affects downstream feasibility, sequencing, and policy alignment. As illustrated by the discovery and framing construct in Figure 2, expanding the problem space before narrowing it enables agencies to distinguish between surface-level symptoms and underlying structural constraints. In environments where user experience spanns independently governed systems, this distinction is necessary to avoid prematurely optimizing for isolated touchpoints while leaving core dependency and ownership issues unresolved.

Figure 2. Discovery & Framing
Structured discovery allows multiple problem statements to be surfaced and evaluated in parallel, including policy friction, data ownership boundaries, identity trust events, and continuity-ofservice risks. Framing then reduces that set to a smaller number of problems that are both materially impactful and realistically addressable within existing governance and funding structures. This progression does not assume a specific technical approach. It establishes a shared understanding of which problems warrant coordinated action and which constraints must be respected when sequencing change.
Applying this lens prior to solution selection supports the development of approaches and policies that remain adaptable as contributing systems evolve on different timelines. Rather than forcing synchronization through a single delivery event, the outcome is a more flexible operating model in which systems can advance independently while still contributing to a cohesive Veteran experience. This flexibility reduces integration risk, supports continuity during transition periods, and allows policy and experience decisions to be revisited as backend capabilities mature.
In FEMA's Grants Management Modernization program, early discovery and framing were used to distinguish experience-layer requirements from program-specific policy and system constraints, enabling multiple grant systems to transition on independent timelines while maintaining a consistent applicant experience. The disciplined discovery and framing are less about speed and more about preserving optionality. By clarifying problem ownership and interdependencies early, agencies retained the ability to adjust sequencing without destabilizing the experience layer or introducing regressions for end users. For initiatives of this scale, that adaptability is a prerequisite for sustained improvement rather than a byproduct of implementation.
Discovery and framing operate across the full replacement model to establish shared problem definitions, decision boundaries, and sequencing assumptions before individual experiences are modernized. Viewed through this lens, identity proofing, sign-in, recovery, and navigation emerge as continuity-of-service workflows whose effectiveness depends on how policy, ownership, and dependencies are resolved across systems.
Sign-in and account recovery workflows function as continuity-of-service mechanisms rather than edge cases. At VA.gov scale, recovery is a routine interaction driven by common life events such as device changes, lost credentials, incomplete enrollment, or multi-factor authentication failures. When recovery spans multiple identity providers, applications, and support channels, lack of clear ownership or inconsistent handling can result in prolonged lockouts, increased support burden, and erosion of user trust.

Post-login navigation introduces a distinct set of considerations. Users often expect a coherent experience across benefits and services, yet navigation is shaped by how backend systems expose eligibility status, task readiness, and allowable actions. Navigation therefore reflects experiencelevel governance decisions rather than purely technical routing. Without clear authority over how eligibility, status, and next steps are presented, navigation patterns may diverge based on system boundaries, policy interpretation, or implementation timing rather than user intent.
These workflows are constrained by backend system ownership, identity architecture decisions, and policy-driven eligibility rules that are implemented and governed across different organizations. Addressing these constraints requires an explicit process for identifying ownership boundaries, decision authorities, and enforcement mechanisms before experience-level changes are assumed. In practice, this involves mapping where identity, recovery, and navigation decisions are made today, which systems are authoritative for each decision, and how exceptions and edge cases are handled across organizational lines. That mapping informs which changes can be sequenced independently, which require coordinated policy alignment, and where experiencelevel authority must be clarified to avoid fragmentation. Without this discipline, replacement or modernization efforts risk embedding unresolved governance questions into delivery assumptions, increasing dependency risk and undermining continuity of service.
Clarity on these questions is essential to evaluating feasibility, sequencing, and delivery risk. Without it, industry assumptions about dependency management, recovery ownership, and crossbenefit navigation will vary significantly, complicating estimation and approach alignment at the RFQ stage.
3.4. Known limitations, risks, and tradeoffs.
Comparable federal platform replacement efforts have revealed several recurring risks that are directly tied to early decisions about scope, sequencing, and ownership rather than to technical feasibility alone. One common risk arises when organizations pursue whole-platform replacement without sufficient phasing. In these cases, assumptions about simultaneous readiness across identity, content, policy, and backend systems tend to concentrate risk into a single transition window, increasing the likelihood of service disruption or delayed delivery.
A second risk appears when experience-layer redesign proceeds without explicit alignment to backend system constraints. User-facing changes that are not synchronized with backend capabilities, delivery cycles, or policy enforcement mechanisms often require workarounds or deferred functionality, creating gaps between intended and actual user journeys. These gaps can persist even when experience designs are well conceived, particularly in environments with independently governed systems and non-discretionary external priorities.
Underinvestment in content governance represents a related but distinct risk. Programs frequently underestimate the effort required to manage policy-driven content, eligibility explanations, and review workflows that underpin user-facing experiences. When ownership of content updates, approvals, and exception handling is unclear or distributed, experience changes may lag policy decisions or be applied inconsistently across services, affecting trust and predictability.
These risks are not inherent flaws of platform replacement. Rather, they reflect tradeoffs associated with how an agency defines the problem it intends to solve, the degree of institutional change it is prepared to absorb, and the tolerance for interim inconsistency during transition. Decisions about whether to phase or consolidate change, how tightly to couple experience and backend evolution, and where to vest authority for content and policy interpretation materially influence cost, schedule, and the realism of delivery expectations. Absent clear articulation of scope boundaries, phasing assumptions, and ownership expectations prior to RFQ release, these risks tend to surface as divergent vendor assumptions, uneven proposals, and execution approaches that require material recalibration after award.

3.5. Lessons learned from past deployments.
Experience from executed FEMA and U.S. Air Force programs indicates that successful platform modernization is driven more by clarity of ownership and governance than by the selection of specific technologies. In FEMA disaster assistance and grants modernization efforts, progress slowed when user experience-level changes, including navigation, content presentation, and workflow behavior, required coordination across independently governed systems without a clearly defined decision authority. Delivery improved only after responsibility for user-facing behavior, content interpretation, and exception handling was explicitly assigned, underscoring that governance clarity, rather than tooling, was the primary factor influencing momentum.
A second consistent lesson is that user trust is degraded more by inconsistency than by the pace of change. In FEMA environments supporting large, time-sensitive user populations, incremental changes to access and workflow behaviors were generally well tolerated when experiences remained predictable across digital, call center, and in-person channels. By contrast, inconsistent recovery paths or conflicting guidance across channels increased repeat contact and user frustration, even when underlying systems were operating as intended. This experience reinforced that consistency across access and support journeys is more critical to maintaining trust than the speed of experience redesign.
Past deployments also demonstrate that governance models must be intentionally designed and sustained. In U.S. Air Force digital platform environments integrating multiple independently delivered applications, experience decisions were initially left to individual application teams operating on different delivery cycles before policy and decision authority were clearly established. Over time, this resulted in fragmented navigation and uneven enforcement of identityrelated behaviors. Establishing explicit experience-level decision rights and escalation paths enabled alignment without forcing backend convergence, demonstrating that decoupled delivery remains viable when policy and experience authority are resolved in advance.
Taken together, these lessons underscore that platform replacement is an ongoing coordination effort rather than a single technical event, in which policy, governance, sequencing, and ownership decisions must be established early to enable phased delivery without degrading user trust.
Viewed across these considerations, the patterns, risks, and lessons described in this section indicate that approach viability and estimation confidence depend on clarity in several foundational areas prior to RFQ release. These include how VA defines the scope of change, how experience-level decisions are governed across independently managed systems, how identity, recovery, and navigation responsibilities are allocated, and how transition risk is intended to be phased and absorbed. Addressing these questions upfront would enable industry to align assumptions, propose comparable approaches, and develop estimates that reflect VA's operational realities rather than inferred constraints.
4. Descriptions of relevant technologies and approaches.
Technologies supporting large-scale, public-facing platforms such as VA.gov are most appropriately considered at the category and pattern level rather than as discrete product choices. In environments where a single experience surface integrates services delivered by multiple independently governed systems, technology effectiveness is determined less by selection and more by how integration, governance, and operations are coordinated across organizational boundaries.
Experience platforms typically function as the primary mediation layer between users and backend services. In comparable federal environments, these platforms are responsible for rendering content, orchestrating user journeys, and enforcing experience-level standards such as accessibility, consistency, and messaging. Their role is not limited to presentation, but includes coordinating navigation, surfacing eligibility context, and managing transitions between services. Experience platforms are most effective when paired with clear authority over experience behavior

and when designed to accommodate incremental change without requiring simultaneous backend convergence.
Identity integration patterns provide the connective tissue between credential providers, identity services, and applications. Common patterns include federated authentication models, assurancebased authorization, and orchestration layers that decouple applications from individual identity providers. These patterns allow identity decisions such as proofing level, authentication strength, and recovery outcomes to be applied consistently across services while preserving flexibility as identity ecosystems evolve. Their effectiveness is closely tied to governance decisions regarding where identity policy is defined, how recovery is handled, and how identity context is reused across user journeys.
API-driven aggregation models are frequently used to assemble user-facing views from multiple backend systems without requiring those systems to be tightly coupled. These models support experience-layer composition of data such as eligibility status, task readiness, and next actions while allowing backend systems to maintain independent lifecycles. In practice, expectations for data latency, partial availability, and use of authoritative sources are established through policy and governance decisions prior to implementation, and aggregation layers succeed when those decisions are reflected in clear contracts, versioning discipline, and shared understanding across contributing systems.
Across these categories, content management and policy-driven update frameworks play a critical enabling role. User-facing content in regulated environments is often tightly coupled to statutory language, eligibility rules, and review workflows. Technologies that support structured content, traceability, and controlled publishing help ensure that experience changes remain aligned with policy intent and can be updated predictably as rules evolve.
Taken together, these technology categories illustrate that platform capability emerges from the interaction of experience, identity, integration, and content patterns rather than from any single component. Decisions about how these technologies are combined, governed, and sequenced are as consequential as the technologies themselves, and directly influence scalability, resilience, and the ability to adapt over time without disrupting user trust.
The technology categories described above are widely understood and broadly available across the federal market. What varies materially, and directly affects approach viability and estimation realism, is how VA intends to govern and apply them. Prior to RFQ release, industry would benefit from clarity in several areas that shape how these technologies can be combined into a coherent operating model.
Specifically, clarity is needed on whether experience-level decisions are intended to be centrally governed or federated across program and system owners, and how conflicts between experience consistency and backend constraints will be resolved. Direction on how identity context, including proofing outcomes and recovery status, is expected to be shared and enforced across applications would inform viable identity integration patterns. Similarly, understanding which user journeys VA expects to be composed at the experience layer versus owned end-to-end by backend systems would shape appropriate use of aggregation models.
Finally, clarity on content and policy ownership, including how statutory updates, eligibility explanations, and exception handling are reviewed, approved, and published, is essential to determining how experience platforms can evolve without introducing inconsistency or delay. Absent this information, industry responses will necessarily rely on inferred assumptions about governance and sequencing, increasing variance across proposals and limiting comparability at the RFQ stage.
5. Any additional information relevant to VA's objectives.
The VA.gov replacement model presents an opportunity to reassess the operating model that governs how digital experiences are designed, delivered, and sustained across VA, not solely the

technologies that enable them. In environments of this scale and sensitivity, outcomes are driven by how authority, accountability, and sequencing are structured across experience, identity, content, and backend systems over time.
These observations are not intended to constrain VA's technology choices, but to highlight the governance and operating assumptions that most directly influence approach viability and estimation realism.
Clear articulation of VA's intent, including whether the objective is platform evolution or reset, how experience-level decisions are expected to be governed, and how transition risk is intended to be phased and absorbed, will materially improve the quality and comparability of industry responses. When these parameters are explicit, industry can focus on proposing approaches that align with VA's operational realities rather than inferring constraints or optimizing for divergent assumptions.
The observations and patterns described in this response are offered to support VA's market research objectives by highlighting the decision points that most influence feasibility, estimation realism, and long-term sustainability. Continued engagement between VA and industry as objectives and constraints are refined would enable more targeted, actionable input and position future solicitations to elicit approaches that are both credible and aligned with VA's mission priorities.
