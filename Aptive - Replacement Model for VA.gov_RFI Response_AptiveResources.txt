1. Company Overview Aptive Resources is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Woman-Owned business and an ISO 9001, ISO 20000, and ISO 27001-certified federal contractor with CMMI Level 3 maturity. With more than 250 professionals supporting over a dozen federal agencies, Aptive specializes in complex, high-visibility federal initiatives where reliability, governance, and sustained operational performance are essential.
Aptive has supported enterprise-scale digital platforms and modernization efforts across the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense, and civilian agencies, working in environments that demand continuous availability, regulatory compliance, and public trust.
2. Understanding VA's Objectives and Constraints Aptive understands that replacing VA.gov is not solely a technical migration. Meaningful improvement requires coordinated evolution across user experience and design, platform architecture, content strategy, analytics, governance, and operating models.
Based on our experience supporting similar federal platforms, a VA.gov replacement effort must:
 Maintain uninterrupted service for millions of Veterans, families, and stakeholders
 Integrate with a diverse ecosystem of legacy and emerging systems
 Operate within a highly regulated, highly visible federal environment
 Improve usability, clarity, and trust without compromising security or compliance
 Support long-term scalability, adaptability, and resilience
We view VA.gov not as a single website, but as a federated service ecosystem that must balance user changing needs, policy requirements, and operational realities over time.
Based on Aptive's experience supporting large-scale, high-availability federal digital platforms, replacing VA.gov is best understood as a phased modernization effort rather than a single cutover event. In practice, agencies pursuing similar transformations typically adopt one or a hybrid of the following established approaches, each with distinct benefits and tradeoffs.
Incremental Replacement
This approach incrementally replaces legacy capabilities while legacy and modern components operate in parallel. New functionality is introduced in a controlled manner, allowing VA to maintain uninterrupted service while validating performance, security, and user experience improvements over time.
This option is commonly used in federal environments where downtime and large-scale migration risk are not acceptable.
Federated Digital Platform Model
Under this model, VA establishes shared platform services, such as identity, navigation, design systems, analytics, and hosting, while individual benefit portfolios retain ownership of their content, workflows, and backend systems.

This approach supports consistency at the enterprise level while allowing portfolios to modernize at different speeds based on readiness, funding, and policy constraints.
Experience-Layer Decoupling
This approach focuses on modernizing the front-end user experience independently of legacy benefit processing systems. By decoupling presentation and navigation layers from backend systems, VA can improve usability, accessibility, and clarity without disrupting mission-critical transactions.
This model is particularly effective for reducing user confusion and improving task completion while backend modernization continues in parallel.
In practice, a successful VA.gov replacement effort would combine elements of all three approaches to balance operational risk, user experience improvements, and long-term sustainability.

3. Relevant Capabilities and Approaches 3.1 Large-Scale Digital Modernization Aptive supports modernization efforts serving broad user populations where downtime is not acceptable. Our approach emphasizes phased transformation, introducing new capabilities while preserving service continuity. This includes:
 Incremental platform evolution rather than wholesale replacement  Release sequencing aligned to operational risk and user impact  Parallel operation of legacy and modern components during transition periods This approach reduces disruption while allowing VA to test, learn, and adapt as modernization progresses. 3.2 Complex System Environment Integration VA.gov operates within a complex ecosystem that includes legacy benefit systems, modern cloud platforms, identity services, analytics tools, and external partner integrations. Aptive supports:  Dependency mapping and interface analysis  Integration planning across heterogeneous systems  Cross-organizational coordination among technical, content, security, and policy stakeholders Our experience shows that successful replacement efforts explicitly plan for system interdependencies rather than treating them as downstream technical details. 3.3 Governance and Operating Model Design Sustainable modernization requires governance models that evolve alongside the platform. Aptive helps agencies establish:  Clear ownership and decision rights across portfolios

 Defined escalation paths for experience, policy, and technical conflicts  Repeatable review and release processes that balance speed and control For platforms like VA.gov, governance is not overhead, it is a core enabler of scale and resilience. 3.4 Human-Centered Experience Design Aptive applies human-centered design to improve how users find information, understand options, and complete critical tasks. Our approach aligns:  User research and journey mapping  Content strategy and information architecture  Organizational processes that sustain experience improvements We emphasize designing within policy, accessibility, and security constraints, recognizing that federal user experience improvements must often occur within fixed guardrails. 3.5 Risk-Informed Implementation Planning Aptive identifies risks, dependencies, and tradeoffs early in the modernization lifecycle. Our planning approach supports:  Realistic sequencing of technical and organizational change  Change readiness across internal teams and stakeholders  Proactive communication to maintain trust during transition This risk-informed discipline is essential in environments where service disruption directly affects access to benefits and care.

5.2 Lessons Learned
Based on Aptive's experience supporting large-scale federal digital platforms, effective replacement efforts are grounded in phased modernization to manage operational risk, early alignment on governance and decision rights across portfolios, and explicit ownership of identity-dependent user journeys. Successful programs also design within policy, security, and compliance constraints rather than attempting to work around them, and establish operating models built to support continuous evolution rather than one-time transformation.
Common challenges include fragmented portfolio ownership, unclear accountability, underestimating the governance and change management effort required to sustain modernization, and insufficient alignment between technical and organizational change. Addressing these risks requires early agreement on operating models, clear accountability for cross-cutting services such as identity and navigation, and governance structures that mature alongside the platform.
By acknowledging these tradeoffs upfront, VA can more effectively sequence modernization activities, set realistic expectations, and sustain progress without compromising reliability, trust, or continuity of service.
6. Closing Summary
Aptive brings proven experience supporting the evolution of large, mission-critical federal digital platforms. We help agencies modernize responsibly, balancing reliability, integration, user experience, and long-term sustainability, while operating effectively within complex, highly regulated environments.
We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to VA's planning efforts and welcome follow-on discussions to explore approaches, workflows, and lessons learned in greater detail.
