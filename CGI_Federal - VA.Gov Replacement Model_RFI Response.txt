 Enhanced Security and Compliance: MSPs possess specialized expertise in cybersecurity and can assist businesses in adhering to intricate compliance requirements, thereby mitigating the risk of breaches and their associated costs.
 Access to the Latest Technology: MSPs are tasked with remaining up-to-date with technological advancements, offering VA access to state-of-the-art tools and solutions.
 Cost efficiency: VA can bypass the substantial expenses associated with recruiting, training, and retaining an internal IT workforce. Instead, VA incurs consistent subscription fees and consumption pricing to achieve cost reductions.
3.3 Additional Ideas and Approaches
According to "VA Serving American Veterans Trust" report in FY2024*, VA.gov recorded over 50 million visitors, nearly five million logged-in users, and more than half a million form submissions, underscoring the importance of VA.gov as a primary connection point between VA and its constituents. Given the critical importance of this channel for communication, outreach, and engagement with veterans and caregivers, innovation in this domain must be driven through the lens of an iterative human-centric approach, we offer the following foundational ideas that should be central considerations for the future of VA.gov.
 Flexible and scalable resourcing to streamline changes and updates aligned to business processes.
 Streamlining login and identity verification process, currently very complicated.  Managing process and teams to revise, review, and refresh content and site architecture.  Embracing a mobile first approach, designing all user experiences to be seamless and easy
to use, whether you're engaging through a desktop, laptop, or a mobile phone.  Integrating agentic AI capabilities and intelligent content customization to offer
personalization of the experience for each user. Modernized human-centered experiences apply the `Know Your Customer' principle to customize the content presented to them.  Leveraging AI-enabled assistance, transforming the experience from searching for answers to delivering actionable outcomes on an individual customer basis. For example, VA.gov requests could be formatted conversationally using current day AI capabilities.  Redesigning all forms to be filled in online and signed digitally, versus the current PDF versions of printed documents.  Adding AI and interactive support into the experience at the point of each inquiry.
3.4 Case studies or examples from similar environments
To support this response, we have used our long-term experience with CMS as a detailed example of the breadth of engagement where we have partnered with an agency to design develop, deploy innovate, and improve the experience for the more than 65 million beneficiaries of Medicare programs, a program of significant nationwide scale with similar user needs and expectations. This experience is outlined in Section 3.7, Lessons learned from past deployments.

and understanding the current user journey and pain points across the site provides the foundational insights that will inform technology choices around systems, processes and architecture.

Figure 3. CGI Human centered design approach from Insights to Continuous Improvement
Our approach is designed to be highly collaborative and scalable, ensuring that VA stakeholders and Veterans are fully integrated into the process at each step of the journey. We actively leverage our partnerships with Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to convene Veteran, caregiver, and beneficiary user groups to capture insights to inform and test innovations.
3.5.1 Insight Gathering
As part of a human-centered design approach, insight gathering involves structured research to understand user needs, behaviors, and pain points. This process typically includes interviews, surveys, and observational studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Findings are analyzed and synthesized into actionable insights that guide design, system and architecture decisions, ensuring solutions are aligned with real user and program requirements to deliver measurable value.
3.5.2 Journey Mapping
Journey mapping is a structured approach CGI uses to visualize the end-to-end user experience across touchpoints. It identifies key stages, interactions, and pain points in the user's journey, providing a clear view of where improvements can deliver the greatest impact. By mapping these steps, teams gain actionable insights into user needs and expectations, enabling the design of solutions and architectures that enhance usability and user satisfaction. VA has many journey maps in existence, but few that align commercial user expectations (e.g., amazon.com or MyChart Patient Portal) to their interactions with VA.gov as a digital no-wrong-door experience.
3.5.3 Prototyping
Prototyping is an iterative process used to validate design concepts and gather user feedback before full development. It ranges from low-fidelity wireframes that outline structure and functionality to high-fidelity, interactive prototypes or clickable demos that simulate the final experience. This progression enables stakeholders and users to visualize solutions early, identify usability issues, and refine designs and process steps efficiently, ensuring alignment with user needs and program objectives.
3.5.4 User Testing
User testing is a critical component of human-centered design, ensuring solutions meet real-world needs and expectations. Approaches range from formative testing during early design stages to summative evaluations of near-final products. Common methods include usability testing, A/B testing, and remote or in-person sessions where users complete tasks while feedback and

VA Replacement Model for VA.gov

performance metrics are captured. These insights drive iterative improvements, validate design decisions, and reduce risk before deployment. We engage the VSOs and the user community throughout this process for real-time feedback.
3.5.5 Launch and Learn
A soft launch provides a controlled introduction of a new feature to a limited user group before full-scale deployment. This approach allows teams to validate functionality, monitor performance, and gather real-world feedback under production conditions while minimizing risk. Key activities include defining target user segments, implementing feature flags or phased rollouts, tracking usage metrics, and addressing issues promptly. Insights from the soft launch inform refinements, ensuring stability and user satisfaction prior to general release. Through our deep nationwide relationships with local, county, state, and nationwide VSOs and stakeholder groups, we actively monitor user uptake and adoption using validated key performance indicators.
3.5.6 Continuous Improvement
Continuous improvement for a newly launched digital experience involves ongoing monitoring, analysis, and iterative enhancements to optimize performance and user experience. Key activities include tracking analytics, conducting regular usability reviews, gathering user feedback, and implementing incremental updates based on data-driven insights. This approach ensures the experience remains aligned with evolving user needs, business objectives, and industry best practices, delivering sustained value over time. The innovation process does not stop once a service is launched, instead we apply continuous improvement, a vital consideration for a dynamic and evolving user experience.
3.5.7 Measuring and improving the user experience
Measuring the user experience and applying the data to improve the experience are key elements of the ongoing improvement process for CGI's high performing digital service teams. User experience indicators include task completion rates, time-on-task, click-through rates, and journey completion metrics, complemented by sentiment analysis and intercept surveys. Scoring is based on positive responses across satisfaction, trust, and ease-of-use dimensions; these metrics the feed into and enable data-driven continuous improvements to the Veteran experience.
3.5.8 Accessibility incorporated from the outset.
VA.gov serves a variety of users and CGI recognizes the importance of making the digital experiences accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing comparable and optimized access to content and functionality. CGI has an internal Human Factors Practice (HFP) that provides testing support and compliance training on best practices of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
In summary, decisions concerning system architecture, content management, navigation, and editorial style should be tailored around enabling the future VA.gov solution to share information and guide Veterans and other end users in the most streamlined, engaging, informative, and personalized way possible. The Federal government has outlined core principles in the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act, Public Law 115-33 that continue to drive digital transformation initiatives, and CGI aligns with these principles and has integrated these into previous Federal modernization efforts. Included in these principles are the following requirements:

3.6 Limitations, risks, and tradeoffs
CGI recommends decoupling the three core layers of system architecture: UX, business logic, and data components. This approach ensures flexibility, adaptability, and a future-oriented solution across the program, allowing for data migration, content updates, adaptability and system resilience. Below is an outline of our experience and lessons learned at CMS.
3.6.1 Cloud Migration
CGI designed and developed CMS.gov and the CMS intranet using Web Content Management System (WCMS). In 2019, CGI helped CMS migrate the website and content from Percussion into Drupal 8 (a SaaS WCMS), hosted in the Acquia Cloud, aligning with the U.S. Digital Playbook drive towards open solutions. This migration included a redesign of the sites implementing a new design system that aligns with the Digital.gov design systems. CGI migrated 4 sites within CMS.gov, and approximately 200,000 pieces of content implementing a new content strategy and information architecture allowing CMS to leverage content within Drupal for multiple channels including their websites, Medicare publications, marketing communications, or mobile applications.
3.6.2 Updating the content
At CMS, this process included content analysis, identifying redundant, outdated and trivial content, content type definition and mapping, creating migration scripts, developing content types, configuring Drupal to support navigation, taxonomies, user authentication, grouping of content, permissions, configuring the editorial experience, training, user's manuals, and user support. All artifacts created for each of these actions have been stored in CMS's Confluence so these items can be shared easily, and updates can be made quickly ensuring users are getting the most recent information as possible.
Drupal code is managed in GIT and uses Cloud Bees Jenkins for automated code deployment. All Drupal sites implemented SOLR search allowing users to find information sitewide, single signon with multifactor authentication (MFA), HTML with CSS and APIs to reshape CMS content and allow access to other channels, such as mobile devices and a page to host CMS Podcasts. CMS's first mobile application was developed by CGI, the Department of Health and Human

Contract Description and Relevance to RFI

CGI migrated DOI websites from an IBM hosted environment to a cloud-based PaaS Drupal CMS. The migration was a lift and shift of Drupal version 7 (D7) and version 8 (D8) websites to Acquia's Enterprise Cloud Platform. Once migrated, CGI supported site upgrades to the latest Drupal version, site redesigns, and porting of non-Drupal sites to Drupal on the new platform. These efforts implemented transformative, secure, cloudbased web hosting and content management services. This transformation reduced DOI's web presentation costs and internal engineering risk, improved levels of service for both internal and external customers and provided a predictable cost model for ongoing website and content management operations. CGI, with our partner Acquia, implemented a modern, user-focused, flexible, scalable, secure, and highly available web hosting environment.
