We apply a structured, user-centered, and technology-driven approach to website modernization, grounded in Human-Centered Design and Design Thinking, and executed within Agile frameworks. This empowers us to create digital experiences that are intuitive, inclusive, secure, and scalable. For the VA, this translates into platforms that reduce friction, simplify access to information and services, and evolve as veterans' expectations and behaviors change over time.
Our methodology follows an iterative roadmap that prioritizes continuous learning, validation, and delivery. Every step incorporates a deep understanding of user context, including veterans' service history, digital literacy, accessibility needs, and emotional burden when navigating benefits or healthcare information. This ensures that solutions are meaningful for veterans and their families while being viable and efficient for the VA organization.
A key advantage of our approach is the close collaboration between UX and development teams throughout all phases of the lifecycle, from early discovery to implementation and deployment. Designers and engineers work together to align user experience decisions with technical feasibility, security standards, and long-term scalability. This reduces rework and ensures that the portal's modernization process results in a stable, compliant, and maintainable platform that can grow with VA priorities.
By combining iterative design, Agile delivery, and crossfunctional collaboration, we deliver digital products that are coherent, resilient, and frictionless. For the VA, this means faster implementation cycles, more consistent delivery quality, and measurable improvements in how veterans navigate and engage with online services.
1. Continuous Product Design: Understanding Needs and Shaping the Right Experience
This stage ensures that modernization begins with a deep understanding of veterans' needs, behaviors, and expectations. Through research, evaluation of the current site, and early design exploration, we identify what aspects of the experience need to be simplified, modernized, or reorganized. By defining clearer navigation, more intuitive flows, and accessible design foundations, we set the stage for a portal that is easier to use and more aligned with how veterans seek information, apply for benefits, or manage their healthcare. This design phase ensures that every decision is purposefully grounded in improving the daytoday experience of the veteran.
Limitations, Risks and Tradeoffs: During the design phase, early insights may be constrained by gaps in existing data, legacy documentation, or uneven user feedback, which can introduce uncertainty into initial decisions. There is also a risk that design assumptions may need to be reevaluated once deeper technical constraints, regulatory requirements, or integration dependencies emerge. Additionally, aligning multiple VA stakeholders may slow momentum, requiring tradeoffs between rapid progress and comprehensive crossteam validation. These risks can be mitigated through structured discovery, early technical feasibility checks, stakeholder alignment workshops, and iterative validation cycles that allow the design to adapt as new constraints or insights surfacee ensuring the final direction remains both usercentered and feasible within the VA ecosystem.
2. Continuous Product Build: Developing Secure, Accessible, and HighPerforming Solutions.
Once the vision is defined, we start working in an iterative, collaborative build approach. Designers and engineers work sidebyside to develop features, validate functionality, and stabilize components as they evolve.

in sprints while steadily advancing the portal's maturity, implementing core capabilities as navigation, search, forms, personalization, analytics, required integrations, and restructuring or migrating content to improve clarity, consistency, and SEO.
Each increment undergoes rigorous validation to ensure a seamless, highquality experience. We verify functionality and regression stability, confirm accessibility compliance, and ensure crossbrowser and crossdevice compatibility. In parallel, we optimize load and runtime performance, conduct security and vulnerability assessments, and validate SEO configurations alongside analytics instrumentation, ensuring every enhancement is stable, secure, and ready for realworld use by veterans and VA teams.
For veterans, this means a more reliable website: faster load times, clearer interactions, fewer errors, and an overall smoother digital experience.
Limitations, Risks and Tradeoffs: During the build phase, modernization efforts may be impacted by legacy systems, fragmented data structures, or integration complexities that were not fully visible during design. These constraints can force tradeoffs between ideal user experience and technical practicality, especially when legacy interoperability limits full modernization in early increments. Incremental releases may also introduce temporary inconsistencies as modern and legacy components coexist. Additionally, sprint velocity can be affected by compliance checks, security reviews, and resource availability. These challenges can be mitigated through early integration assessments, close collaboration between engineering and architecture teams, continuous alignment with security and compliance stakeholders, and the use of feature toggles or phased enablement to maintain consistency and control risk as new capabilities are introduced.
3. Continuous Product Deploy: Learning for improvement and evolution.
Modernization is not a onetime effort; it is an ongoing commitment to ensuring the platform remains reliable, secure, and aligned with the VA's operational priorities. During this stage, we continuously monitor site performance, security posture, and user behavior to confirm that the platform is functioning as intended. As updates become necessary, we implement refinements informed by analytics and business needs, while also evolving the design system and component library to maintain consistency and scalability across the experience. At the same time, we ensure that the CMS, integrations, and underlying infrastructure remain stable and up to date so the platform can support future growth.
As part of deployment and rollout, Softtek manages the transition from the legacy platform to the modernized website through a phased release approach that moves from pilot environments to broader expansion and ultimately full rollout. Throughout this transition, we validate performance under real operational conditions to confirm that the platform behaves as expected within the VA ecosystem. After launching, we provide hypercare support to ensure issues are addressed quickly, and operations remain stable. We also train VA teams on CMS usage, analytics, and content operations, so they are fully equipped to manage and sustain the platform moving forward. This combined approach ensures that the VA portal remains robust, compliant, and reliable, while enabling a smooth transition to a modernized experience that can evolve responsibly as the organization's needs progress.
For the VA, this means a modernization approach that prioritizes operational excellence and sustainability; for veterans, it ensures a consistent and reliable digital service experience as the platform evolves responsibly over time.
