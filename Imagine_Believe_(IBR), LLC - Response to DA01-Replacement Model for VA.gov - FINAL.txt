Replacement Model for VA.gov Capability Statement

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The VA.gov replacement is not a technology refresh, it is a mission-critical modernization that must

maintain continuity of service for millions of Veterans while improving user experience, platform

architecture, content strategy, governance, and analytics across a complex ecosystem of legacy and

emerging systems.

Imagine Believe Realize, LLC (IBR) is a mission-focused digital services firm specializing in human-

centered design, agile delivery, and low-code/no-code modernization for federal agencies. Since 2014, our

software and systems engineering solutions have driven positive change for the Department of Defense and

numerous federal agencies. IBR maintains mature standard operating procedures validated by adherence to

industry best organizational certifications and appraisals including CMMI-DEV Maturity Level 3, ISO

9001:2015 (Quality Management), ISO 27001:2022 (Information Security), ISO 20000-1:2018 (IT Service

Management), and ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management), and CMMC Level 2.

TEAM IBR OVERVIEW: IBR leads this effort as prime contractor, partnering with Liferay, Inc., the

global provider of a leading Digital Experience Platform (DXP) serving thousands of enterprises and

government agencies worldwide. Together, Team IBR delivers enterprise-grade platform capabilities

combined with federal program execution excellence through a phased replacement model that prioritizes

risk reduction via incremental modernization, parallel operations, feature toggles, and timely rollback

capabilities. Our approach embeds human-centered design (HCD), security, privacy, and accessibility from

sprint one, with measurable outcomes tracked through continuous optimization and real-time observability.

Furthermore, our work on DoW recruit-to-retire portfolios like Navy HR, USMC HR, and Air Force HR

allows us to design a VA.gov experience that feels like a seamless continuation of their service, rather than

a disconnected administrative restart.

Team IBR proposes Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP) as the foundational architecture for this

transformation. Liferay DXP is engineered specifically for mission-critical, highly regulated environments,

offering a unified solution that balances modern user experience with the rigorous governance and security

required by the federal government.

Liferay is not a new entrant to the VA ecosystem; it is a proven partner. The Liferay platform currently

powers the MyHealtheVet experience on VA.gov, facilitating secure, authenticated healthcare journeys for

millions of Veterans. By leveraging Liferay for the broader Replacement Model, the VA utilizes a platform

already vetted for security and interoperability within its own environment. This significantly de-risks the

transition from legacy systems to a modern, identity-aware architecture.

In the 2025 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Digital Experience Platforms, Liferay achieved the highest

ranking for the "Authenticated Experience" use case. This independent validation confirms Liferay's

superiority in managing the exact type of secure, personalized, and role-aware digital journeys that the

VA.gov Replacement Model requires.

1.1 Understanding the Challenge

VA.gov is the digital embodiment of a national promise to Veterans, families, caregivers, and survivors often during "moments that matter" when time, clarity, and trust are critical. As shown in Appendix 1: Figure 1, VA serves a diverse user population across generations, ability levels, and technology access scenarios, making inclusive design mission-critical. The core challenge is delivering a cohesive, reliable, accessible experience across a complex ecosystem of benefits, health, identity, and content services without disrupting access to critical services.
The VA.gov replacement must address five interdependent realities:
Trust is fragile in high-stress engagements. Veterans often engage VA services during urgent circumstances to include medical crises, disability claims, housing instability, survivor benefits, or civilian transition. Fragmented navigation, confusing authentication, error loops, or broken recovery paths are not minor usability issues; they erode trust, suppress completion, and increase reliance on phone and in-person channels.
Identity and navigation are inseparable foundations. Veterans need consistent pathways across applications, content, and transactional services. Brittle sign-in and recovery cause task abandonment. Confusing post-login navigation means improved authentication alone will not improve outcomes.
Modernization must maintain continuity. VA.gov cannot afford a "big bang" cutover. The platform must continue serving millions while components are modernized, requiring incremental migration, parallel operations, and controlled rollout.
Integration complexity drives user experience complexity. VA's service portfolio depends on many legacy and emerging systems with distinct data models, security constraints, and performance behaviors. Successful replacement requires modern API patterns, eventing, caching, and experience-layer abstraction that minimize negative impacts on availability and reliability of the system.
Compliance and visibility heighten risk. VA.gov operates in a regulated environment with strong expectations for security, privacy, accessibility, and performance. Modernization must incorporate these as engineering and product constraints from day one through governance, testing, monitoring, and release discipline.
The right replacement model is a program of disciplined, incremental transformation that reduces Veteran burden and improves outcomes while preserving continuity, integrating complex systems, and maintaining security and accessibility.
Company Overview and Relevant Capabilities. Imagine Believe Realize, LLC (IBR) is a Small Business specializing in large-scale digital platform modernization for DoD and Federal Civilian agencies. We deliver high-visibility portal replacements, human-centered experience design, identity and authentication integrations, cybersecurity, content governance, and cloud transformation in regulated federal environments.

1.1.1 Core Competencies Relevant to VA.gov

Large-Scale Portal Operations and Modernization. IBR operates the MyNavy Portal (MNP), the second most visited DoD website in FY2024 with 1M+ registered users and 25M+ annual visits. MNP demonstrates our capability to deliver at VA.gov scale through flexible content management, threat-tested cybersecurity, Human-Centered Design implementation, and continuous performance monitoring.

Replacement Model for VA.gov Capability Statement
maintained over 99% system uptime during complex migrations.
Service-to-Veteran Lifecycle Continuity. The transition from active service to Veteran status should be seamless, not an abrupt disruption. IBR brings deep experience delivering systems at scale that deal with everything from "recruit-to-retire" across the DoD, including MyNavyHR, the Marine Corps' Manpower Information Technology Systems Modernization (MITSM), and the Air Force's Recruiting Information Support System (AFRISS).
This unique vantage point ensures we understand the career milestones, digital interfaces, and administrative logic Service Members are accustomed to. We leverage this "recruit-to-retire" expertise to build VA.gov experiences that feel familiar and intuitive, stemming from the systems they used in uniform, minimizing the anxiety and cognitive load often associated with navigating a new agency.
Platform Replacement Using Incremental Migration. IBR has executed large-scale platform replacements using the Strangler Fig Method to transition legacy systems from monolithic, on-premises architectures to resilient, distributed cloud-first architectures. We successfully transitioned over 30 HHS enterprise web applications from on-premise environments to AWS cloud in 24 months, reducing implementation timelines by 50%, cutting ATO assessment costs up to 70%, and achieving automationenabled provisioning in under one hour with 100% security compliance.
Identity and Authentication in High-Security Environments. As part of MNP, IBR developed and operates the Identity and Credential Access Management (ICAM) solution integrating Okta with MFA, SSO, and CAC/PIV authentication across multiple systems within the MyNavy HR portfolio. Our experience delivering authentication solutions for high-security federal web environments positions us to understand the complexities VA faces integrating Login.gov, ID.me, and emerging credential providers.
Human-Centered Design and Accessible Experience Delivery. IBR operates an HCD Center of Excellence (CoE) that standardizes best practices for Design Thinking, Usability, and Human Factors Engineering. Our proven HCD process has been successfully applied across numerous government clients, including the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as civilian federal agencies. We design end-toend service journey maps, build design systems and plain-language content standards, and validate usability through rapid prototyping and iterative delivery.
Technical Architecture. Our Liferay DXP's headless CMS architecture, demonstrated through MNP's mobile application, decouples content delivery from presentation, enabling dynamic, efficient delivery across devices. We implement API-first platforms that abstract frontend user experiences from backend system complexity, providing flexibility for new system integration without disrupting user experiences.
Creating Guided Digital Experiences. Our approach ensures Veterans, caregivers, and beneficiaries successfully access care and benefits quickly and confidently. WalkMe embeds real-time, contextual guidance directly into VA.gov, transforming complex processes into clear, Veteran-centered experiences. Operating like "GPS for digital services," WalkMe overlays step-by-step assistance within live applications without requiring system changes, helping users complete tasks at the moment help is needed.
1.1.2 Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges
MyNavy Portal (MNP): Modern Digital Experience at Scale Description: Enterprise portal supporting large, dispersed user community with high visibility and missioncritical content and workflows. Over the last 10 years, IBR has served as trusted partner to the Navy Program Executive Office for Manpower, Logistics and Business Solutions (PEO MLB) and OPNAV N1, to design, develop, deliver, and support the Navy HR Single Point of Entry (SPOE). The foundation of the SPOE capability is MNP, powered by Liferay DXP and extended by Navy HR mobile apps and the Navy HR Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) system providing single sign-on through Okta. These capabilities are in production, at scale, supporting more than one million active users globally with 99+% system uptime.

systems, applied journey-based organization transforming legacy Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) to MyNavy Portal focused on Career and Life Events tracking service member journey from recruitment through retirement, implemented independent remote identity proofing leveraging MyAuth to facilitate credential establishment, supported headless and API-based patterns enabling multi-channel delivery, obtained and maintained RMF ATO for IL2 capabilities in AWS GovCloud, and developed "Hopper," a Tier 0 self-service GenAI chatbot designed to reduce more than 300,000 annual HR inquiries. This experience directly parallels VA's challenge of serving millions of Veterans through a central digital platform supporting complete lifecycle journeys, with identity proofing implementation demonstrating capability to integrate independent verification solutions meeting federal security standards while maintaining user-friendly workflows. USPS Enterprise Web Portal: Modernizing Access and Governance Description: Over the last four years, IBR established the new USPS Digital Experience Platform (DXP) and Content Management System (CMS) serving as the common user experience and central access point to all HR information, resources, and tools for more than 630,000 existing and 2,800 prospective USPS employees nationwide. We aggregated content scattered across multiple legacy environments into enterprise portal experience with search and SEO improvements, established documented governance shifting from person-dependent content management to role-based repeatable workflows, delivered modern responsive interface with consistency patterns, integrated platform with multiple backend systems, and provided dedicated technical training enabling government personnel to independently manage and maintain platform. This project demonstrates IBR's capability to aggregate scattered content, implement enterprise search, and establish governance processes, all challenges VA faces with modernizing VA.gov.
U.S. Census Bureau DAHRTS: Identity Verification in Federal Environment Description: The Decennial Administrative Recruiting, Hiring and Training System (DAHRTS) for the U.S. Census Bureau supports public applicant intake, hiring operation, and lifecycle case management while maintaining strict compliance with federal security and PII requirements. We implemented secure workflows for user onboarding, authentication, and controlled access to sensitive processes, supported compliance-driven engineering practices appropriate for federal oversight, and designed flows mindful of diverse technology access and varying digital literacy. This demonstrates our experience with secure account creation workflows, recovery workflows, clear communication, and designing for varying digital literacy levels directly applicable to VA's user experience challenges. MyHealtheVet: VA.gov (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) Description: Liferay DXP currently serves as the portal layer on VA.gov, facilitating secure, authenticated access for Veterans to MyHealtheVet services. Liferay supports secure, authenticated Veteran healthcare interactions enabling Veterans to request and store key portions of their VA electronic health record in a personal eVault. This confirms the platform's practical compatibility integrating with existing Veterans Health Administration practices, delivers secure authenticated services on a federal scale, and provides clear proof that Liferay is suitable for VA.gov's top priority: consistently and reliably delivering authenticated Veteran journeys.
1.2 Approach to Enhanced Digital Identity, Authentication, and Navigation
Identity is a journey, not a login screen. IBR views identity as an end-to-end journey: identity proofing (when required), sign-in (routine access), step-up authentication (high-risk actions), recovery (device loss, forgotten credentials), and post-login navigation and task completion.
1.2.1 Identity Proofing Approach: Achieving Near-Universal Success
VA seeks authentication as simple as unlocking a phone while achieving near-universal (approaching 100%) identity proofing success. A replacement model must not assume smartphone ownership, reliable broadband, high digital literacy, or consistent device access.

Department of Veterans Affairs Sources Sought Notice ID: 36C10B26Q0131
Replacement Model for VA.gov Capability Statement
Leverage VA's In-Person Footprint for Identity Establishment. VA possesses a unique advantage that commercial identity providers lack: an extensive in-person footprint through VA Medical Centers, Regional Offices, and community-based outpatient clinics. Veterans already visit these facilities and have established trust relationships with VA staff. Implementation Approach. Veterans visiting VA facilities for any reason could optionally complete a a brief identity proofing process. VA staff would verify government-issued ID, capture a photograph, and optionally collect biometrics (fingerprints, facial recognition). The Veteran would simultaneously enroll a FIDO2 security key or passkey tied to their personal device (smartphone, tablet, or computer). Once this one-time in-person enrollment is complete, the Veteran can subsequently authenticate to VA.gov using only their enrolled device and biometric (fingerprint or face unlock) or device PIN, achieving the goal of authentication as simple as unlocking a phone while maintaining the highest identity assurance. Advantages of This Approach.Veterans who struggle with remote identity verification due to thin credit files, expired IDs, or complex digital workflows can successfully complete in-person proofing, dramatically increasing success rates toward the 100% target. This leverages existing infrastructure requiring no new physical locations or significant facility modifications, builds on trust relationships where Veterans trust VA staff and facilities, provides one-time friction with lifetime ease where initial in-person enrollment requires visiting a facility once with frictionless authentication for all future VA.gov access, and supports diverse populations including Veterans without smartphones, those with disabilities, those with limited digital literacy, and those who prefer in-person interactions. For Veterans who can complete it successfully, continue supporting Login.gov and ID.me remote proofing options.
1.2.2 Authentication That Balances Security and Usability
Not all actions require the same assurance. Low-risk informational access should remain simple allowing Veterans to access general information with minimal authentication including email-based magic links or lower-assurance credentials. Medium-risk profile actions should use strong but usable authentication methods requiring AAL2 authentication optimized for ease using passkeys, biometrics, or remembered devices. High-risk actions should trigger step-up authentication and risk checks requiring AAL2 with additional context validation, and for unusual access patterns (new device, new location, high-risk action), prompt for step-up authentication. Appendix 1: Figure 3 illustrates this risk-based authentication model, showing how transaction types trigger appropriate authentication assurance levels based on sensitivity and fraud risk.
1.2.3 Account Recovery Without Frustration
Recovery is frequently the most painful step. Veterans need graceful recovery paths that acknowledge the reality that access problems will occur and provide clear, achievable solutions. IBR recommends leveraging VA's extensive physical footprint to enable in-person recovery at any VA facility, allowing Veterans who have lost access to regain it through a trusted, face-to-face interaction. We also propose phone-based assisted recovery, where VA contact center staff trained in identity verification assist Veterans through workflows in real time, providing human support when digital self-service fails. For Veterans with partial account access, we recommend progressive recovery workflows that provide graduated pathways balancing security requirements with accessibility needs, allowing Veterans to regain full access incrementally rather than starting from zero. All recovery processes should feature clear guidance and plain language with predictable outcomes and visible next steps, ensuring Veterans understand exactly what they need to do and what will happen when they do it. Critical to success is the reduction of "looping" failures where Veterans repeatedly enter the same information or encounter vague errors that provide no path forward, creating frustration and abandonment.
1.2.4 Navigation and Task Completion Improvements

Department of Veterans Affairs Sources Sought Notice ID: 36C10B26Q0131
Replacement Model for VA.gov Capability Statement
Authentication is only the first step. Veterans must find information and complete tasks successfully. We recommend organizing VA.gov around Veteran goals and life events rather than VA organizational structure. Veterans should find pathways for "Apply for disability benefits" or "Schedule a medical appointment" without needing to understand which VA administration handles these services. This approach proved successful in our transformation of Navy Knowledge Online to MyNavy Portal, where we focused on Career and Life Events tracking a user's journey from recruitment through retirement. Key navigation improvements include clear post-login landing experiences aligned to "next best action," search that supports plain language, synonyms, and Veteran terminology, guided workflows with progress indicators for complex processes, consistent design patterns throughout so Veterans can transfer knowledge from one task to another, and clear, jargon-free language with simplified forms broken into manageable sections with pre-filled information VA already knows. Errors in digital submissions like missing information, incorrect entries, or incomplete forms can also significantly delay decisions and service delivery. Implementing WalkMe proactively prevents these issues by guiding users through validated, prescriptive paths, ensuring required information is entered correctly before submission. Organizations leveraging WalkMe have achieved up to 87% fewer submission errors, improving data quality and accelerating downstream processing. We experienced this during the User Acceptance Testing for the Marine Corps Manpower Information Technology Systems Modernization (MITSM) program, where the integration of WalkMe resulted in a more than 22% increase in Net Promoter and System Usability Scores. For VA, this means faster adjudication, fewer resubmissions, and more timely delivery of care and benefits.
1.2.5 Intelligent Assistance
IBR successfully developed a proof of concept using a large language model AI chatbot for MyNavy Portal. Named "Hopper," this bot crawls and indexes content across the portal, enabling users to receive fast, contextually relevant answers, dramatically reducing search overhead. For VA.gov, IBR recommends AIpowered conversational interfaces where Veterans ask questions in natural language and receive relevant answers, links, and guided workflows; intelligent search with semantic understanding surfacing relevant results even when Veterans use different terminology; guided workflows that walk Veterans through complex multi-step processes with plain language explanations and progress indicators; and proactive benefit recommendations based on Veteran profile and eligibility. Any AI-enabled features must include oversight and escalation paths where AI systems operate within clearly defined human governance structures, accuracy monitoring to ensure AI outputs remain reliable over time with detection of declining performance and hallucinations, transparency allowing users to clearly distinguish between AI-generated content and authoritative validated sources, and bias and safety controls to detect, mitigate, and monitor bias and unsafe behavior throughout their lifecycle.
1.2.6 Accessibility and Inclusive Design
IBR will apply inclusive design patterns pragmatically across all digital touchpoints. Our approach prioritizes predictability through consistent layout, clear progress indicators, and stable navigation that allows Veterans to develop transferable knowledge across the platform. We ensure transparency by providing plain-language explanations of processes, making data use visible and understandable, and displaying clear system status at every interaction point. Error clarity is central to our design philosophy, eliminating "dead ends" and circular loops while providing actionable error messages that guide Veterans toward successful task completion. We implement progressive disclosure strategies to reduce cognitive load by presenting only the information and options needed at each step, preventing overwhelm while maintaining access to more detailed information when Veterans need it. Recognizing that digital-only solutions leave some Veterans behind, we design multiple paths to completion that accommodate online self-service, assisted digital options, and in-person-friendly recovery processes, ensuring that every Veteran can access their benefits regardless of their digital comfort level or circumstances.

1.3 Approach to VA.gov Replacement
VA Objective: Replace VA.gov in a way that maintains continuity, improves experience across benefits portfolios, integrates complex systems, and remains secure, accessible, and resilient. IBR Recommended Approach: A Phased, Incremental Replacement Model IBR recommends a replacement program executed through phases that maintain service continuity while progressively modernizing the experience and underlying platform. Phase 0 (Optional): Alignment and Readiness (30-60 days)
· Confirm priority "moments that matter" and define outcome metrics · Establish governance and decision points (product, content, security, platform) · Define reference architecture and integration strategy · Set accessibility and security quality gates and evidence expectations Phase 1: Discovery and Foundation (Research + Architecture Baseline) Comprehensive User Research: We will begin with comprehensive user research across diverse Veteran populations, leveraging HCD methodologies to engage users through site visits and journey mapping. We will conduct site visits at VA Medical Centers, Veterans Service Organizations, and community settings to ensure our research includes Veterans who may not actively use VA.gov today but need these services. This means conducting research with Veterans representing the full spectrum of capabilities and circumstances: aging-related challenges, cognitive impairments, physical limitations, low digital literacy, rural connectivity constraints, and those without smartphones. Appendix 1: Figure 1 illustrates these diverse VA user demographics that will be represented in our research activities. Current State Assessment: We will develop a comprehensive Current State Assessment documenting VA.gov's existing architecture, integration points, content inventory, user journeys, and pain points. This assessment will identify opportunities for quick wins that can be delivered early while establishing the foundation for long-term transformation. Lifecycle-Based Content Organization: We will work with VA to develop a lifecycle-based content and service organization framework for Veterans, from transition to civilian life through end-of-life benefits, ensuring content and services are organized around Veteran needs rather than VA organizational structures. Appendix 1: Figure 2 illustrates how VA.gov can support Veterans through lifecycle stages with this approach. Phase 2: Incremental Modernization and Migration (Strangler Pattern) Rather than attempting a risky "big bang" replacement, we will incrementally replace VA.gov capabilities with modern equivalents. We will employ the Strangler Fig Method to transition enterprise systems from monolithic architectures to resilient, distributed cloud-first architecture using AWS GovCloud, minimizing risk by deploying incremental changes. Appendix 1: Figure 4 depicts our proposed modernization path for VA.gov, illustrating the phased Strangler Fig approach that enables progressive transformation while maintaining continuous service delivery. Dual-Track Delivery Model: We will establish a dual-track delivery model where one team maintains the current platform while another builds the modern replacement. Rigorous Testing: Each new capability goes through rigorous user testing with diverse Veteran populations before being promoted to production. Progressive Traffic Shifting: As each new capability reaches production readiness and passes accessibility, security, and usability standards traffic gradually shifts from legacy to modern systems using intelligent routing that can be instantly reversed if problems are detected. Optimization and Continuous Improvement: Once core capabilities have been modernized, we will focus on optimization, advanced features, and continuous improvement based on analytics and user feedback. Why this model works for VA: · Minimizes risk by avoiding large cutovers

· Produces value early while building durable platform foundations · Aligns technical modernization with experience outcomes and governance
1.4 Maintaining Continuity of Service and Integrating Legacy Systems
Continuity of service for millions of Veterans is paramount. IBR brings proven experience maintaining over 99% system uptime during complex migrations. Continuity Strategy: We maintain existing pathways while introducing new components through parallel operations and progressive cutover. Legacy and modern systems run in parallel with routing rules steering traffic subsets to new services by journey, region, or cohort. Intelligent routing enables instant reversal if problems are detected, with backend changes invisible to end users, minimizing disruption. WalkMe modernizes user experience without reengineering backend systems, overlaying human-centered guidance across existing applications. This "modernize in place" approach reduces risk, accelerates timelines, and delivers immediate Veteran-visible improvements. We release behind feature flags, deploying new capabilities to small populations first, monitoring performance before expanding access. Every deployment includes tested rollback procedures executable within minutes, with rapid rollback protecting mission outcomes when issues arise. Upgrades occur during low-traffic periods with rolling updates when possible. We design modern VA.gov as an API-first platform abstracting frontend experiences from backend complexity. Standardized API interfaces and mapping layers reduce coupling, providing flexibility (integrate new systems without disrupting user experiences), reusability (leverage APIs across mobile apps and other VA services), and centralized security (API gateways provide authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and threat protection)
1.5 Security, Accessibility, and Compliance in Federal Environment
1.5.1 Security Approach in Regulated, High-Visibility Environment
IBR delivers security as a continuous engineering practice, not a compliance afterthought. We have extensive experience supporting clients during annual Authority to Operate (ATO) maintenance cycles, including updates to System Security Plans (SSP), Security Assessment Reports (SAR), and POA&M documentation. We collaborate with agency ISSMs to ensure platform controls remain aligned with RMF and FedRAMP frameworks. DevSecOps Approach: Our DevSecOps approach embeds security scanning tools (Twistlock, SonarQube, Fortify) in the CI/CD pipeline to check for vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. IBR's development processes incorporate Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices using GitLab as the foundation for DevSecOps pipelines. Security Practices Include:
· Secure SDLC with automated testing gates and evidence capture · Threat modeling for identity and high-risk transactions · Dependency management and vulnerability remediation SLAs · Logging/monitoring aligned to incident response and reporting needs · Risk-based and adaptive authentication that adjusts assurance levels based on transaction
sensitivity and fraud risk
1.5.2 Privacy and Trust
Veterans must understand what data is being collected, why it is needed, how it will be used, and how to recover when something fails. We prioritize transparency and clarity in content and UI behavior because it directly reduces abandonment and increases trust.
1.5.3 Accessibility
The platform must conform to WCAG 2.1 AA and Section 508 requirements. IBR treats accessibility as a

first-order requirement from Sprint Zero, not something to be retrofitted. Our experience confirms that retrofitting accessibility is exponentially more expensive and time-consuming than building it in from the start. Accessibility support includes screen readers, keyboard navigation, captions, and assistive technologies, with automated and manual testing integrated into sprint increments and design systems that enforce accessibility patterns across teams.
1.5.4 Resilience Against Emerging Threats
IBR's defense-in-depth approach addresses VA's specific concerns regarding AI-generated synthetic identities, deepfake biometric attacks, large-scale credential theft, and long-term cryptographic threats through layered security controls proven on mission-critical federal platforms. Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection. AWS GuardDuty provides AI-driven behavioral modeling and anomaly detection, identifying suspicious activities like abnormal login patterns. For VA.gov, we implement session behavior analysis establishing baseline authentication patterns for each Veteran, tracking login times, geographic locations, device fingerprints, and transaction sequences. When deviations occur (login from unusual location followed by high-value benefit changes), the system triggers step-up authentication or flags the session for review, countering account takeover while minimizing friction for legitimate users. Our Salesforce Shield and Event Monitoring implementations track anomalous behavior in real time, providing the foundation for similar capabilities within Liferay-based platforms where session analytics detect synthetic identity usage through pattern inconsistencies. Continuous Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Management. IBR maintains continuous monitoring using DoD-approved SIEM integration, automated vulnerability scans, prioritized patching, and documented remediation. Our threat intelligence integrates real-time feeds from CISA, FBI IC3, and commercial providers to identify emerging attack patterns targeting federal identity systems, correlating feeds against authentication logs to detect credential stuffing campaigns, phishing infrastructure, or new attack vectors. Regular vulnerability scans with DISA STIGs application and security documentation updates in eMASS ensure continuous RMF compliance. Security assessments occur within each development sprint, with critical vulnerabilities patched within hours and threat intelligence automatically updating detection rules to counter emerging synthetic identity techniques and deepfake attempts. Zero Trust Architecture with Continuous Validation. IBR implements Zero Trust Architecture principles through Identity, Credentials, and Access Management (ICAM), ensuring continuous authentication, segmented access, and least-privilege controls. Rather than granting access once at login, our model validates every request against current context: user identity, device health, network location, and transaction sensitivity. We leverage Okta's SaaS-based identity management for centralized, secure authentication with controlled access, reducing the attack surface and enabling adaptive, risk-based access controls. For Veterans accessing benefit information (low-risk), validation requirements remain minimal. When submitting disability claims or updating direct deposit information (high-risk), the system requires fresh authentication, device verification, and may invoke additional factors. This continuous validation mitigates credential theft impact because stolen credentials alone cannot authorize sensitive transactions without matching device, location, and behavioral context. Phishing-Resistant Authentication with Cryptographic Proof. IBR implemented comprehensive Single Sign-On and Multi-Factor Authentication serving millions of DoD users, including CAC-less and CACfree access leveraging Okta MFA, requiring collaboration with DoD CIO to obtain exceptions based on innovative MFA approaches. Our implementation supports FIDO2/WebAuthn standards enabling passwordless authentication using public key cryptography. Unlike traditional MFA where phishing sites can intercept one-time codes, FIDO2 cryptographically binds authentication to the legitimate VA.gov domain; phishing sites cannot complete the authentication challenge even if a Veteran is tricked into visiting them. For Veterans using biometric unlock on modern smartphones, this delivers intuitive security meeting VA's goals of user experiences as easy as unlocking their phones while exceeding NIST AAL2

requirements. Liferay's OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0 integration capabilities provide the federation framework to broker these FIDO2 credentials across VA's digital ecosystem. AI-Resistant Identity Verification and Fraud Detection. To counter AI-generated synthetic identities and deepfake biometric attacks, IBR proposes multi-modal verification combining government authoritative data sources with liveness detection. Our DHS implementation provides advanced AI/ML capabilities for person identification and master profile creation, combining multiple sources and validating against open-source data. For VA, this means cross-referencing identity proofing attempts against VA enrollment records, DoD personnel databases for Veterans with military service records, and IRS data for financial history validation. Synthetic identities, which typically lack authentic cross-system correlation, trigger additional verification requirements. Liveness detection during biometric capture prevents deepfake attacks by requiring real-time interaction (random gestures, orientation changes) that pre-recorded or AIgenerated video cannot replicate. AWS WAF leverages ML to detect sophisticated web threats and botdriven attacks using behavioral analysis, while Security Hub aggregates and prioritizes security alerts from AI-driven sources, enabling detection of coordinated synthetic identity campaigns. Cryptographic Resilience and Post-Quantum Preparation. IBR implements FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography and NIST-approved algorithms (FIPS 140-2 Annex A: AES or Triple DES) with continuous compliance through the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program. Our cryptographic architecture uses crypto-agility principles, separating cryptographic primitives from application logic so algorithms can be updated without application redesign. As NIST finalizes post-quantum cryptographic standards, VA.gov infrastructure can adopt quantum-resistant algorithms through configuration updates rather than platform rewrites. We implement perfect forward secrecy for all TLS connections, ensuring that even if long-term keys are eventually compromised by quantum computing advances, past sessions remain protected. All sensitive Veteran data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 with hardware security module (HSM) key management, and field-level security protects sensitive data through encryption in transit and at rest, MFA, and role-aligned access controls. Risk-Based and Adaptive Authentication. Recognizing VA's specific interest in risk-based and adaptive authentication that adjusts assurance levels based on transaction sensitivity and fraud risk, IBR implements dynamic authentication policies evaluating risk signals in real-time. Each Veteran interaction receives a risk score based on device trust (known vs. new device), behavioral consistency (matches historical patterns), network reputation (trusted location vs. TOR exit node), and transaction sensitivity (viewing pay statements vs. changing beneficiary designations). See Appendix 1: Figure 5 for Support for Multiple Identity and Authentication Capabilities. Low-risk scores allow seamless access; medium-risk scores trigger additional verification (confirming via authenticator app); high-risk scores require full reauthentication with multiple factors. This approach balances security and usability by applying friction only when risk warrants it, directly supporting VA's need to align different Veteran actions and services to different assurance levels. These integrated capabilities create resilient authentication infrastructure that adapts to emerging threats while maintaining the inclusive, accessible experience required to serve Veterans of all ages, abilities, and circumstances.
1.6 Scalability, Adaptability, and Resilience
VA.gov must handle massive scale (16M+ unique users per month, 10M+ authentications), adapt to evolving needs, and remain resilient against threats. Our cloud-native approach using AWS GovCloud provides horizontal scalability where services automatically scale during peak demand and down during low-traffic, global distribution through CloudFront CDN ensuring fast load times regardless of location, and multi-region deployment with automated failover. Recognizing connectivity constraints, we implement Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities maximizing accessibility for geographically dispersed users, optimized assets through image compression and lazy loading, and offline-first design where critical content remains accessible during connectivity interruptions with seamless synchronization when restored. We break down applications into loosely coupled microservices communicating through language-agnostic

APIs, with each microservice containerized with Amazon EKS for orchestration supporting automated deployment, scaling, and monitoring. This allows VA to adapt quickly where new services can be added, existing services enhanced or replaced, and emerging technologies adopted without wholesale replacement.
1.7 Measurement and Continuous Improvement
IBR recommends an outcome-based measurement model that establishes clear metrics tied to VA's objectives. Our measurement framework tracks identity proofing success rates by demographic factors to identify disparities, while monitoring authentication friction through metrics such as time to authenticate and abandonment rates. We continuously measure task completion rates to ensure Veterans successfully accomplish common tasks, and we validate accessibility conformance through both automated and manual testing processes. User satisfaction is captured through regular surveys and Net Promoter Score tracking, while support contact volume serves as a proxy for user experience quality, with the understanding that fewer support calls typically indicate a more intuitive system. Performance metrics including time to interactive, API latency, and error rates provide technical health indicators that directly correlate to user experience. Qualitative Veteran feedback loops are strategically tied to release cycles to ensure that realworld user insights inform development priorities and technical decisions. Measurement is not a reporting exercise; it is the mechanism by which VA.gov improves continually without large disruptive releases. WalkMe provides actionable insight into real Veteran behavior, identifying where users struggle, abandon tasks, or require assistance. These insights allow VA leaders to prioritize improvements based on evidence, ensuring digital investments translate into measurable Veteran outcomes. These metrics will be provided in a report to the government for tracking progress. Periodically we will reevaluate the metrics that are collected and adjust to include additional measurements to align with the goal of continuously improving the platform and the Veteran's experience.
1.8 Lessons Learned Applicable to VA.gov
Drawing from our experience across MyNavy Portal, USPS Enterprise Web Portal, and Census DAHRTS, IBR has identified critical lessons directly applicable to VA.gov modernization. The most successful transformations begin with deep understanding of user needs, pain points, and journeys before selecting platforms or architectures. The Strangler Fig Method employed across our projects demonstrates that incremental replacement of legacy capabilities dramatically reduces risk compared to "big bang" migrations, succeeding when built as a sequence of small, measurable outcomes. Scattered content and inconsistent governance create user confusion regardless of platform capabilities, making content governance, ownership models, and standardized processes as critical as technical improvements for protecting continuity and quality over time. Our experience across DoD and civilian agencies confirms that accessibility must be treated as a first-order requirement from Sprint Zero, with design consistency as the foundation of trust and accessibility at scale. MyNavy Portal's transformation from organization-centric to task-based navigation dramatically improved user success rates, demonstrating that Veterans should find content organized around their goals and life events, not VA's organizational structure. Plain language and task-based design drive measurable improvements in user success.
1.9 Commitment to VA's Mission
IBR recognizes that VA.gov is a critical gateway through which millions of Veterans access earned benefits and services. We approach this opportunity with deep respect for Veterans' service and commitment to ensuring every Veteran can successfully navigate VA's digital services regardless of circumstances, abilities, or technical sophistication. Our objective is to reduce Veteran burden, increase successful task completion, protect continuity of service, and ensure improvements work for Veterans with the greatest barriers, not only those with the newest devices and strongest connectivity.

Liferay: A Flexible Path to a Modern Digital Experience for Government Agencies
Many agencies are striving to offer more modern, personalized, and responsive experiences to the citizens, employees, and businesses they serve. They increasingly understand that delivering a good customer experience has important benefits beyond simply meeting people's rising expectations -- it also leads to better customer engagements, citizen trust, and mission outcomes. Leaders at the Veterans Affairs Department, for example, understand that the difference between a good and bad customer service can even translate into life or death when it comes to the mental health, support, and treatment of veterans today. Recognizing this, governmentwide initiatives such as the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA) are pressing agencies to meet specific objectives as they improve their digital experiences for citizens, employees, and other stakeholders. These objectives include: modernizing websites, improving customer satisfaction with federal digital services, offering customers more self-service options, and enabling users to track their status and get estimates of waiting and response times. Yet, many agencies struggle to meet these goals due to constraints brought on by legacy systems, fragmented data, outdated data, or an inability to personalize digital services for specific individuals.
The U.S. Navy's Sea Warrior Program Office replaced a group of legacy portals with a modern, consolidated solution based on Liferay DXP, creating a single site for Navy career management information. The solution: · Consolidates human resources, education, and training information in a
single interface · Automatically personalizes homepages and permissions according to rank · Improves web experience for 870,000 potential users
