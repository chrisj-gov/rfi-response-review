1. On the CCDSO program, we automated Enterprise Precision Scanning and Indexing tool (EPSI) that reduced the time required to index medical documents from 10 minutes to 3 minutes, greatly improving efficiency
2. On the EHRM program, we were the core team behind the launch of Oracle-Health Joint Health Information Exchange (JHIE) that boosted interoperability, reaching over 90% of U.S. hospitals. By 2025, JHIE connected 100,000+ provider sites and exchanged 360M documents across 18M patient matches.
3. At VA National AI Institute (NAII), we are advancing AI-driven innovations within the VA ecosystem. We have deployed various potential AI pilots such as Community Care Document (eFax) Ingestion to improve Veteran health outcomes to alleviate VA users workload burden.
4. On the HDSO program, we were part of the Integrated Scheduling System (ISS) team that consolidates several scheduling applications into one location, reducing time Veterans must wait while appointments are confirmed and scheduled.
5. On the FMBT iFAMS IVV program, we have delivered several accomplishments, notably being reducing iFAMS deployment and field risks as noted in the recent GAO-25107256 report.

RESPONSES TO TOPICS AND QUESTIONS
VA.gov has made meaningful progress over the years in unifying Veteran-facing digital services through the collective efforts of Office of Chief technology Office (OCTO) within Office of Information Technology (OIT), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). However, as several persistent experience and operational challenges remain that limit scalability, transparency, and ease of use for Veterans and VA staff.
We spoke with various Veterans and synthesized some key pain points and lessons learnt that they have experienced using VA.gov:
1. Content creation and maintenance are slow and resource-intensive, making it difficult to keep benefit guidance current, consistent, and written in plain language across VA.gov.
2. Change management and governance processes are lengthy, particularly for low-risk updates, placing a heavy burden on OCTO review cycles and slowing delivery.
3. Complex and repetitive forms create friction for Veterans, especially when similar information must be entered multiple times across benefits.
4. Fragmented chatbot and virtual assistant implementations result in inconsistent answers, duplicated maintenance efforts, and user confusion.
5. Limited transparency after benefit or claim submission, leaving Veterans uncertain about next steps and driving avoidable customer service interactions.
6. VBA and VHA service discovery requires understanding VA.gov website structure, making it difficult for non-tech-savvy users to find the right benefits or services.
7. Veterans want effective self-service, but without being trapped in endless chatbot interactions or waiting to connect with the contact center human agents.

These challenges are not isolated technical issues; they span experience design, platform architecture, governance, and operating models.
HIGH LEVEL MODERNIZATION IDEAS /CONCEPTS
In shaping our modernization ideas and concepts, we draw inspiration from proven digital experience patterns used by large-scale Business to Customer (B2C) platforms such as Amazon.com, not because of its retail function, but because of its demonstrated ability to deliver trusted, intuitive, and resilient digital experiences at national and global scale. Amazon serves a broad and diverse user population that spans generations, abilities, cultures, and levels of technical proficiency. Its success lies in designing experiences that are easy to understand for both the tech and non-tech-savvy users like that of Veteran community, efficient for frequent users, low touchpoints with human agents, and reliable services under heavy demand. The patterns - simple navigation, suggested products and services based on the user profile and search/order history, clear next steps, persistent identity, transparency, and contextual assistance would come familiar to millions of Veteran users and therefore also offer a low learning curve.
Our core principles for VA.gov modernization are rooted in:
 Building a Veteran trust at scale, through clear communication, predictable workflows, and transparent status updates.
 User personalization with smart searches, suggestions, enabling relevant experiences without confusing or overwhelming users.
 Operational resilience, supporting millions of concurrent Veteran users across distributed systems.
 Friction-reducing journeys, with minimal black-box or human agent touchpoints especially for complex, multi-step benefits transactions.
By applying these proven patterns thoughtfully, VA.gov can evolve into a digital experience that feels familiar, intuitive, and dependable--reducing cognitive burden on Veterans and accelerating adoption--while remaining fully aligned with the realities of a regulated federal environment.
For the purposes of this RFI response, we are not attempting to boil the ocean of modernizing the full VA.gov at once, but do it in steps while focusing on the key concepts that include:
 Intent-based experiences, enabling Veterans to navigate services based on life events and goals rather than organizational (VHA, VBA, NCA) boundaries.
 Transparency by default, providing clear, plain-language status updates throughout benefit and claim journeys.
 Composable platform services, allowing shared capabilities (identity, forms, notifications, analytics) to be reused across benefit portfolios.
 Balanced automation, prioritizing self-service while enabling seamless escalation to human support when needed.
 Human-in-the-loop AI to accelerate content creation, change management, and form completion while preserving oversight and accountability.

DESCRIPTIONS OF RELEVANT IDEAS, CAPABILITIES, AND APPROACHES
1. Account & Identity Experience (Borrow from "Your Account")
Pattern: Treat identity as a persistent relationship, not a one-time login.
VA.gov Feature Ideas  Unified "My VA" Account Home o A single landing page that shows:  Active benefit applications  Pending actions ("Upload income verification")  Upcoming deadlines  Recently viewed benefits o Similar to Amazon's "Your Orders" + "Your Account"  Progress Transparency o Visual progress bars for claims, appeals, and forms o Clear "what happens next" timelines o Plain-language explanations of delays  Smart Account Recovery o Multiple recovery paths (not just email)  ID.me + Login.gov fallback logic  Knowledge-based or device-based recovery o Clear "you're locked out because..." messaging
Result: Why this matters to VA: reduces call center volume and restores user trust during high-stress interactions.

2. Navigation & Discovery (Borrow from Amazon Search + Recommendations)

Pattern: Users don't navigate categories, they search with intent, and adapt.
VA.gov Feature Ideas  Intent-Aware Search o Natural language search like:  "I just left the military"  "I need help paying for school"  "I'm transitioning out"  "I'm caring for a Veteran" o Search results grouped by:  Benefits  Forms  Next steps  Human help options  "People Like You" Benefit Discovery o Based on:  Service era

 Life events (discharge, marriage, disability)  Previous VA interactions o "Veterans in your situation often also apply for..."  Contextual Cross-Linking o If a user is filing a disability claim:  Surface healthcare enrollment  Surface mental health resources  Surface caregiver support automatically o "You're here because you're looking for education benefits"
Smart Result: "Veterans who claimed this also claimed..." similar to "Customers who bought this also bought..."
3. Forms & Transactions (Borrow from One-Click + Saved State)
Pattern: Assume users will leave, come back, change devices, or get interrupted.
VA.gov Feature Ideas  Save State Everywhere o Auto-save across all forms o Resume from any device o Visible "last saved" timestamp  Pre-Filled & Reused Data o Reuse verified data across benefits:  Address  Service history  Dependents o Ask once, reuse many times (with consent)  Smart Validation o Real-time error checking with plain English guidance o "You don't need to answer this because we already have it"
Benefit to Veteran: Reduced user drop-offs and less user frustration.
4. Status, Notifications & Automation (Borrow from Order Tracking)
Pattern: Over-communicate status to reduce anxiety.
VA.gov Feature Ideas  Claim Tracking That Feels Human o "Your claim is being reviewed by a VA specialist" o "Average time for this step: 14-21 days" o Clear explanation when delays occur  Event-Based Notifications o Not just "check your account"

o But:  "We received your document"  "We need one more thing"  "You're eligible for an additional benefit"
 Single Notification Center o Email, SMS, in-app messages in one place o User-controlled preferences
Amazon parallel: Order shipped  Out for delivery  Delivered; Product returned  Payment refunded;
5. Customer Support Escalation (Borrow from "Contact Us")
Pattern: Self-service first, human help when needed, never dead ends.
VA.gov Feature Ideas  Guided Help Paths o "What are you trying to do?" o Dynamic troubleshooting trees o Seamless handoff to:  Chat  Secure messaging  Call scheduling  Context-Carrying Support o When a Veteran contacts VA:  Agent sees the page, form, and error encountered o No repeating the story  Call Me Back o Queue avoidance o Time-window scheduling
Result: The best self-service experiences know when to stop being self-service.

6. Personalization & Automation (Borrow from Homepage Personalization)
Pattern: Every homepage is personalized, and smart.
VA.gov Feature Ideas  Personalized Homepage Modules o "Recommended for you" o "Continue where you left off" o "New benefits you may qualify for"  Life Event Triggers o Discharge o Marriage

o Birth of a child o Job loss  Surface relevant benefits automatically  Explainable Personalization o "We're showing this because you recently..."
Critical for Veteran trust: personalization must be transparent, optional, and auditable.

DESCRIPTIONS OF RELEVANT AI-ENABLED TECHNOLOGIES
1. AI-Assisted Content Creation (with Human-in-the-Loop)
Pain Point: Content creation and updates for VA.gov are slow, inconsistent, and labor-intensive.
Treat content as living, versioned, and testable, not static pages. Ideas
 AI Content Drafting for VA.gov o AI generates first drafts of:  Benefit explanations  FAQs  Eligibility summaries o Human editors:  Review  Approve  Publish
 Plain-Language Translation o AI rewrites policy-heavy content into:  "Explain it to me simply"  "Legal version"  "Caregiver version"
 Content Consistency Engine o Detects:  Conflicting guidance across VHA/VBA/NCA  Outdated references to forms or processes
2. Agentic AI for Forms (One of the Highest-Impact Ideas)
Pain Point: Forms are repetitive, confusing, and emotionally taxing.
Improve user friction and design for interruption, reuse, and recovery. Ideas

Ideas

 

Single VA Virtual Assistant o One external-facing assistant o Routes internally to:  VHA logic  VBA logic  NCA logic
Two Modes o Quick Help: factual, fast o Guided Help: slower, contextual, form-aware
Escalation with Context o If human help is needed, the assistant passes the full conversation + page context
