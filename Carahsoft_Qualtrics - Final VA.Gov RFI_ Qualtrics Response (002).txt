QUALTRICS | EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR VA
Modernization Under Pressure: Ensuring VA.gov Delivers for Veterans When It Counts
Challenges to a Successful VA.gov Roll-Out
VA has made real, measurable progress modernizing its IT systems, delivering clear benefits to Veterans. But the size and complexity of VA's mission make further modernization of VA.gov difficult, as is common in large federal enterprises. Challenges include complex governance, legacy systems, and coordination across multiple administrations and mission owners.
These factors contribute to fragmented feedback, limited visibility into end-to-end Veteran experiences, delayed insights, and task-completion issues. Together, they can slow benefits processing, disrupt service delivery, and erode Veteran trust.
At the same time, Veterans are accessing VA services amid heightened oversight and limited resources, increasing the risk of usability friction. When issues go undetected, Veterans may face delays or confusion during critical moments, such as checking eligibility, submitting disability claims, or managing health care online. Identifying these risks early and fixing them quickly is essential to maintaining service continuity, reducing backlogs, and protecting trust in VA's digital front door.
Qualtrics Has Ensured Success for Many High-Stakes Digital Transformations
Qualtrics has supported similar large-scale federal transformations, including work with CMS and the U.S. Navy, where challenges around scale, integration, adoption, and accountability were comparable.
In these environments, Qualtrics enabled continuous, governed listening by unifying user feedback, behavioral data, and UX insights into a single operational view. At CMS, this approach helped teams identify and resolve critical issues on Healthcare.gov and Medicare.gov in under 72 hours by routing real-time frustration signals directly to developers. For the U.S. Navy, Qualtrics reduced analysis cycles from months to near real time, allowing small teams to manage complex, force-wide programs while capturing millions of interactions.
VA.gov faces similar complexity. Qualtrics offers a FedRAMP High-authorized, natively integrated platform designed to help VA turn modernization efforts into better outcomes for Veterans, with measurable improvements in access, clarity, and trust.

QUALTRICS + VA
Differentiators of Qualtrics
While legacy tools capture static survey data in silos, Qualtrics provides an integrated "Intelligence Layer" for VA.gov. Our platform doesn't just ask Veterans how they feel; it sees where they struggle in real-time. By combining human sentiment with digital behavioral signals on a FedRAMP High-authorized platform, we empower the VA to move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive service delivery, reducing the burden on both Veterans and VA staff.

Beyond Surveys: Digital Behavior
Analytics
To truly modernize the VA.gov experience, we must understand what Veterans do, not just what they say. Qualtrics Digital Experience Analytics (DXA) automatically detects frustration signals such as "rage clicks," "mouse thrashes," and "dead clicks" and "error clicks" to identify broken digital journeys in real-time. Layering this capability upon the existing VA.gov survey program, all in a FedRAMP High environment, will allow your team to make rapid fixes to digital infrastructure without relying solely on survey-based reporting of issues.

Low-Code Agility & Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
We empower VA teams to own their programs through a self-service, drag-and-drop interface, eliminating the continuous dependency on costly third-party vendors for routine changes. While competitors typically require a 90-130% services-to-software cost ratio due to heavy configuration needs, Qualtrics averages just 20-30%, delivering rapid Time to Value and significantly reducing the VA's long-term operational costs. This "low-code" approach enables VA staff to configure surveys, dashboards, and workflows in minutes, not months, ensuring the platform evolves as fast as Veteran needs change.

Validated FedRAMP High Security & Immediate VA Readiness
Qualtrics is one of the few cloud providers to offer their full suite of AI capabilities securely within the FedRAMP High boundary, ensuring Veteran data is protected at the highest standards. Unlike competitors requiring lengthy security reviews, Qualtrics currently holds an Enterprise ATO with the VA and supports over 40 mission-critical VA programs. Our platform and team is ready to support the mission of modernizing VA.gov to meet the needs of the Veteran of tomorrow, while equipping you with cutting edge innovation and capabilities.

Unified "One VA" Intelligence
Qualtrics serves as the "Experience Layer" for the VA, unifying surveys, behavioral signals, and UX research into a single, role-based view. All housed in a single platform, the VA can move beyond static CSAT scores from website surveys and understand the "why" behind Veteran trends. Through native, API-driven integrations with common VA systems and full data ownership, the VA will be able to embed Qualtrics data into a connected, intelligent ecosystem to drive continuous improvement of VA.gov.

Behavior-Based Website Experience Monitoring to Identify Hidden Signals
Qualtrics Digital Experience Analytics (DXA) empowers the VA to capture a complete view of the Veteran's digital journey beyond surveys by analyzing behavioral signals that indicate user struggle. By identifying blind spots where users drop off, indicate frustration, or fail to complete critical tasks, DXA allows the VA to uncover friction points that traditional surveys often miss. The solution utilizes frustration detection to automatically flag specific behaviors, including Rage Clicks, Mouse Thrashes, Error Clicks, and Dead Clicks, which signal technical failures or confusing interface designs. To diagnose these issues, session replay allows VA teams to reconstruct individual user visits, providing a high-fidelity playback that helps product teams "step into the shoes" of the Veteran to pinpoint the exact moment of failure. Built on a FedRAMP High authorized platform, these tools ensure strict privacy compliance through advanced masking capabilities that automatically redact the capture input fields or page text.

Additionally, heatmaps and funnel analytics visualize and aggregate user behavior to optimize content placement and identify specific drop-off rates in complex workflows like form-based applications and identify management. After visualizing these concentration areas of friction, design teams can adjust information and page hierarchy to best meet the needs of Veterans and promote digital self-service. By pairing these behavioral insights with direct survey feedback, the VA can instantly validate negative feedback with visual evidence, eliminating guesswork and accelerating root-cause analysis. Ultimately, this capability enables the VA to proactively resolve digital fallout, reducing the burden on support channels and ensuring a seamless, resilient path to a successful modernization.

After turning on Digital Experience Analytics, we identified broken links within the first day and the best part is that our digital teams can identify issues and fix them faster by seeing exactly where the frustration occurred and watching the session replay."
