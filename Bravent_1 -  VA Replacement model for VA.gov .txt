Across multiple federal engagements, Bravent has supported large-scale digital platforms that function as authoritative, highly visible entry points for mission-critical information and services.Across platforms such as Acquisition.gov, FAI.gov, Data.gov, DigitalDashboard.gov, and Department of Commerce enterprise web environments, Bravent has supported high-traffic, nationally visible websites serving diverse user populations that include federal employees, industry partners, researchers, policymakers, and the general public. These platforms required reliability, performance, and trust at scale, similar to the expectations placed on VA.gov.Bravent has also repeatedly operated in environments requiring continuous operations during modernization and platform migrations. Modernization efforts were conducted without disrupting public access, regulatory publishing schedules, or mission workflows. This required careful sequencing, parallel operations between legacy and modern components, and disciplined release management—an approach directly applicable to VA’s need to maintain uninterrupted service for millions of Veterans and stakeholders.Many of the platforms Bravent supported required integration with legacy systems, shared services, and agency-specific tools, including enterprise authentication services, content management systems, data repositories, and analytics platforms. These integrations often spanned multiple owners and governance bodies, requiring coordination across organizational boundaries while maintaining system integrity and performance.Bravent’s experience also includes supporting policy-driven content updates where accuracy, traceability, and governance were paramount. For example, Acquisition.gov required precise implementation of regulatory changes with clear provenance and auditability. This type of content governance mirrors the challenges VA faces in managing authoritative benefit, policy, and service information across portfolios.In addition, Bravent has supported platforms subject to security accreditation, SSP maintenance, and audit readiness, operating within federal security and privacy frameworks. This work required coordination with security teams, documentation of controls, and ongoing compliance activities while continuing to deliver enhancements.Accessibility has been a consistent requirement across Bravent’s past performance. Through platforms such as Section508.gov and BuyAccessible.gov, Bravent has supported accessibility compliance at scale, ensuring thousands of pages, templates, and workflows met Section 508 and WCAG standards. Accessibility considerations were embedded into design, development, and operations rather than treated as a post-deployment activity.Taken together, Bravent’s experience reinforces VA’s stated understanding that replacing VA.gov is not a single technical exercise. Effective modernization requires coordinated attention to experience design, platform architecture, content strategy, governance, analytics, and operating models—while preserving continuity, trust, and usability for mission-critical users.2.1 INCREMENTAL MODERNIZATION WITH CONTINUOUS OPERATIONSBravent’s past performance reflects a consistent pattern of modernizing federal digital platforms through incremental, risk-managed approaches that maintain continuous operations. Rather than “big bang” replacements, Bravent has supported phased modernization efforts that allow legacy and modern capabilities to operate in parallel until transition risks are fully mitigated.Examples include:* Migrating large Drupal 7 platforms to Drupal 9/10 while maintaining production availability and uninterrupted public access.* Redesigning and re-architecting DigitalDashboard.gov and Section508.gov from the ground up while preserving existing content, URLs, and user access patterns.* Enhancing Acquisition.gov with new API-based and modular capabilities while maintaining continuity of regulatory publishing and stakeholder trust.These efforts required careful planning around data migration, content integrity, URL persistence, and user experience continuity. Enhancements were introduced incrementally, validated in production-like environments, and released in controlled stages to minimize disruption.This experience supports a replacement model where modernization is achieved through progressive transition, allowing users to benefit from improvements early while legacy components are systematically retired. Such an approach aligns with VA’s need to maintain uninterrupted access to benefits and services throughout the VA.gov replacement effort.2.2 PORTFOLIO-BASED PLATFORM ARCHITECTUREThrough its work supporting the GSA Enterprise Content as a Service (ECAS) and the Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP) Web Portfolio, Bravent has direct experience operating within portfolio-based digital ecosystems where multiple independent websites coexist on shared infrastructure.This model included:* Shared AWS-based hosting environments.* Common DevSecOps pipelines supporting security, testing, and deployment.* Centralized monitoring, logging, and compliance tooling.* Site-specific configurations, governance rules, and content ownership.* Independent release cycles driven by different business owners and priorities.Bravent’s role required balancing standardization with flexibility—enabling shared services and controls while allowing individual sites to meet unique mission needs. Governance structures were essential to coordinate changes, manage dependencies, and ensure consistency without impeding progress.This experience closely mirrors the complexity VA faces in supporting multiple benefit portfolios, business lines, and stakeholder groups under a single digital entry point. Bravent’s past performance demonstrates familiarity with managing shared platforms that must accommodate diverse missions, varying maturity levels, and evolving requirements within a unified technical and operational framework.2.3 IDENTITY-AWARE AND AUTHENTICATED EXPERIENCESBravent’s experience supporting identity-aware and authenticated digital platforms is grounded in its work with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where Bravent has provided services supporting Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) initiatives within a highly regulated federal environment.Through this engagement, Bravent supported platforms that required secure authentication, role-based access control, and seamless user experiences across a diverse set of users, including federal staff, contractors, and external partners. These systems operated under strict federal security requirements and required alignment with enterprise identity services to ensure consistent, reliable access while maintaining compliance.Bravent’s NIH ICAM experience emphasized:* Integration of authentication services with mission-critical applications.* Support for secure sign-in and access workflows across multiple systems.* Consideration of user experience impacts associated with identity proofing, authentication, and recovery.* Operation within enterprise security, privacy, and compliance frameworks.* Coordination with agency stakeholders to ensure identity services supported mission needs without disrupting operations.This experience directly informs Bravent’s understanding of identity-aware digital platforms, where authentication state influences navigation, access to services, and user workflows. Bravent’s work at NIH demonstrates the importance of designing digital experiences that balance security, usability, and operational resilience—an approach applicable to VA’s goal of delivering a secure and Veteran-centric VA.gov experience.2.4 SECURE, CLOUD-NATIVE OPERATIONS AT SCALEBravent has operated large AWS-based federal platforms with:* Auto-scaling infrastructure supporting dozens of production systems.* Infrastructure-as-code using Terraform, CloudFormation, Puppet, and Packer.* Continuous monitoring, logging, and audit readiness. * WAF, Shield Advanced, IAM, encryption, and vulnerability management.These environments support millions of records, high availability, and strict compliance, aligning with VA’s scalability and resilience goals.3 USER JOURNEY WORKFLOW EXPERIENCEBased on prior engagements, Bravent has designed and supported user workflows involving:* Anonymous and authenticated user journeys.* Multi-step forms and guided decision tools (e.g., BuyAccessible.gov)* Regulatory content editing and approval workflows (Acquisition.gov DITA editor)* Cross-agency collaboration and review processes.* Account-based access to internal and external systems.These workflows emphasize clarity, recovery paths, accessibility, and auditability—key considerations for VA.gov user journeys.4 RELEVANT EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTSBravent’s relevant experience is grounded in multiple federal programs that align with different aspects of large-scale, secure, user-facing digital platforms.
