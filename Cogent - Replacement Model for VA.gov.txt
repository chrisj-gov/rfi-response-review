2. Relevant experience with similar challenges.
Cogent supported Washington Health Benefit Exchange on modernization and sustainment of Washington Healthplanfinder, focusing on (1) customer access workflows (sign-in/account recovery), (2) stable enrollment and eligibility user journeys including verification and Document Center document submission, (3) operational readiness for Open Enrollment surge periods, and (4) privacy-first handling of sensitive customer information.
Challenge: Washington Health Benefit Exchange runs a high-traffic, citizen-facing enrollment marketplace where updates must be delivered without disrupting customer access. The biggest risks are (1) sign-in/account recovery issues that block enrollment, (2) breaks in end-to-end enrollment/eligibility workflows especially when verification requires document submission, (3) failures caused by dependencies on multiple partner/dependent systems, and (4) heightened privacy/compliance constraints due to sensitive personal data.
Mitigation: Cogent mitigated these risks by (1) using phased releases with strict release readiness checks and rollback plans to protect availability, (2) prioritizing and hardening identity/signin/account recovery flows through focused testing and production monitoring, (3) mapping integration dependencies early and validating end-to-end scenarios across partner systems before release, (4) stabilizing verification/document-submission journeys with clear user prompts and workflow validation to prevent processing delays, and (5) operating with privacy-first controls in design, testing, and operations to reduce compliance and data-handling risk.
3. Responses to the Topics and Questions in this Request Replacement approach
 Use a phased replacement approach to maintain continuity of service while modernizing VA.gov capabilities.
 Treat modernization as an integrated effort across experience, platform, content, governance, analytics, and the operating model, not technology alone.
 Design for scalability, adaptability, and resilience with release discipline appropriate for a highly visible public service.
 Start with the highest-impact "front door" journeys first (sign-in, recovery, navigation to top tasks), then expand capability-by-capability to reduce risk and accelerate measurable improvements.
 Run legacy and modern components in parallel only where needed, and retire legacy functions in controlled waves to reduce long-term operational burden.
Relevant experience with similar challenges (WHBE)
 Supported Washington Health Benefit Exchange on a statewide public marketplace where availability, secure access, and workflow stability were mission-critical.
 Delivered change while preserving service continuity and coordinating multiple dependent systems and partners.
 Supported enrollment-season surge readiness by aligning release timing, operational readiness, and monitoring to peak usage periods to protect availability and performance.

 Stabilized document-driven verification workflows (including Document Center submission pathways) where users must provide supporting documents to complete eligibility/enrollment actions.
 Operated in a privacy-sensitive environment handling high-risk personal data, requiring disciplined controls across delivery, testing, and operations.
Key workflows (identity proofing, sign-in, account recovery, navigation)
 Identity proofing: Apply step-up verification only when needed, reduce repeat proofing, and keep the user on task.
 Sign-in: Standardize entry points, error handling, and session behavior; ensure users can return to where they left off.
 Account recovery: Provide multiple secure self-service options, clear status messaging, and a safe fallback path without dead ends.
 Navigation: Use task-first information architecture and consistent patterns to reduce drop-offs and improve completion.
 Instrument these journeys end-to-end (entry to completion) so friction and drop-off are visible and prioritized through data, not opinion.
Known limitations, risks, and tradeoffs
 Integration dependencies can constrain release timing; mitigate through early dependency mapping, interface contracts, and end-to-end validation.
 Running legacy and modern components in parallel reduces disruption but increases operational complexity; mitigate through strong governance, rollout controls, and clear ownership.
 Stronger identity controls can increase user drop-off; mitigate through measured step-up verification and monitoring of friction points.
 Peak-period changes increase operational risk; mitigate with freeze windows/stricter controls during surge periods, plus rollback-ready deployments and heightened monitoring.
 Document/verification workflows are error-prone and create downstream rework; mitigate with clear user prompts, validation checks, and status transparency to reduce incomplete submissions.
Lessons learned from past deployments
 Define completion to include operational readiness (monitoring, support playbooks, rollback) before broad rollout.
 Instrument key user journeys early and use analytics to drive iteration and quickly correct friction.
 Use controlled releases and phased cutovers to keep services stable while moving capabilities to the modern platform.
 Treat governance as a delivery accelerator (intake/triage, decision forums, change controls, release readiness) so dependencies and risks are managed early instead of late.
