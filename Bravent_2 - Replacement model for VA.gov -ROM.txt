Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost and Delivery TimelineThis section provides a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and high-level delivery timeline for Bravent LLC’s proposed incremental replacement model for VA.gov. The ROM is provided for planning and market research purposes only and reflects Bravent’s experience modernizing large, mission-critical federal platforms while maintaining uninterrupted public access and continuous operations. 1.1 Scope Assumptions* VA.gov replacement is executed as a multi-year, phased modernization effort, with legacy and replacement components operating in parallel.* VA retains ownership of enterprise identity services, authoritative data sources, and policy decisions.* Bravent delivers platform engineering, experience design, content and workflow modernization, DevSecOps, accessibility, security integration, and O&M.* The approach supports millions of users, high availability, Section 508/WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, and federal security and privacy requirements.* Modernization follows a portfolio-based platform architecture, enabling multiple VA business lines to transition independently.1.2 Order of Magnitude Cost OverviewPeriodEstimated ROMYear 1 – Planning & Pilot Replacement$5.0M – $8.0MYear 2 – Scaled Portfolio Replacement$8.0M – $14.0MYear 3 – Expanded Replacement & Optimization$6.0M – $10.0MSteady-State O&M (Annual)$3.0M – $5.0MEstimated 3-Year ROM Total: $19.0M – $32.0MThese estimates reflect a blended multidisciplinary team supporting design, engineering, content transformation, accessibility, security, DevSecOps, and operations across a national-scale digital platform.1.3 Phased Timeline and Key MilestonesPhase 0 – Program Mobilization (Months 0–2)* Contract kickoff and governance setup* Security onboarding and environment access* DevSecOps pipelines, monitoring, and reporting establishedPhase 1 – Replacement Planning and Pilot Capabilities (Months 3–9)* Mapping of VA.gov architecture, content domains, and workflows* Selection and deployment of pilot replacement components* Parallel operation with legacy VA.gov* Initial accessibility-validated user journeys and metricsPhase 2 – Incremental Portfolio Replacement (Months 10–24)* Expansion of replacement platform across multiple VA.gov portfolios* Incremental migration of content, workflows, and user journeys* Preservation of public access, URLs, and continuity of service* Shared platform services for security, compliance, and analyticsPhase 3 – Optimization and Legacy Retirement (Months 25–36)* Performance, resilience, and security hardening* Systematic retirement of legacy VA.gov components* Establishment of steady-state operating modelPhase 4 – Steady-State Operations (Year 4+)* Ongoing operations, maintenance, and enhancements* Continuous accessibility, compliance, and security monitoring* Incremental modernization based on usage and Veteran feedback1.4 Value to VAThis ROM and timeline reflect a risk-managed, incremental replacement strategy that avoids a single “big bang” transition. The approach enables VA to deliver early improvements, reduce operational risk, preserve public trust, and modernize VA.gov in a controlled, measurable, and Veteran-centered manner while maintaining continuous access to mission-critical services.Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)Technology Acquisition CenterReplacement Model for VA.gov - RFI Notice ID: 36C10B26Q0131
