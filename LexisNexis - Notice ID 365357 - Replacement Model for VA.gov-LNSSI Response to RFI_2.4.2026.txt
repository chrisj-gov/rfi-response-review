· Device Risk Assessment - Delivers device risk assessment insight derived from 5.5+ billion devices from over 185 countries and 200,000+ websites and offers unmatched global riskbased authentication and technology. Sample connections/analytics include Device ID and IP reputations, Device and IP Velocity, First/Last Seen Dates, Location, Known Frauds, and more. Behavioral Biometrics sample capabilities include phone behavior, BOT detection and scoring, and fraud scoring.

 Document Authentication and 1:1 Face Biometrics - Provides document authentication and face biometrics leveraging proprietary Computer Vision Learning Models. Delivers comprehensive coverage for a wide range of identification documents (16,000+), including U.S. passports, Driver's Licenses, ID Cards, and Passport Cards. Additionally, we cover Department of Defense Cards, Armed Forces, Uniformed Services ID Cards, PIV Cards, etc. Globally, we cover virtually any government-issued photo ID document across 220+ countries and territories, supporting 140+ languages and typesets - matching people with their government-issued IDs from all over the world and helping to fight fraud and remain compliant with identity verification requirements. This extensive coverage highlights our commitment to providing secure and reliable identification solutions worldwide. Our liveness and face-matching capabilities verify that the individual is a real person, and the transaction is happening right now, while identifying 100% of "spoof" attacks. We use facial liveness detection that distinguishes between real and spoofed faces, where the spoof may be a 2D/3D mask, mobile/screen replay, deepfake, or printed photo. We use both active and passive liveness presentation attack detection technologies. Biometric face matching verifies the individual behind the device matches the photo on the ID presented with an accuracy of 99.999%. The face match engine has been developed on top of a deep neural network, which enhances the accuracy of the solution and can cater to scenarios and environments that the liveness solution would be subjected to. i.e., unnatural light such as overhead spotlights casting shadows, various objects in the background, accessories such as spectacles or scarves, facial tattoos, differing hairstyles, or facial hair, etc.

· Identity Validation and Verification - Leverages our large database of 300+ million identities resolved with a 99.99% confidence level. Performs matching of a submitted set of PII to compare against all resolved entities in the LNSSI data repository. Descriptive scores and indices include Name Address SSN Index, Name Address Phone Index, Red flags, Reason Codes, Fraud Scores, and Watchlist indicators. The verification process conducts a precise determination with market-leading accuracy of a person's current address based on proprietary algorithms, cross-checks of public records, and address histories. To minimize false positives and maximize the effectiveness and value of results, LNSSI procedures include standardization and normalization of data that leverage more than 100,000 rule sets for address hygiene, name matching, miskeyed data, and other anomalies to effectively resolve approximately 12 billion unique address/name combinations.

These capabilities enable VA.gov to onboard and authenticate Veterans securely while maintaining compliance with federal identity standards.
