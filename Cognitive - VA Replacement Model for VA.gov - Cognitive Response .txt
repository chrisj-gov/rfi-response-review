1. SOURCES SOUGHT INFORMATION VA.gov Modernization Context and Importance: VA.gov serves as the primary digital entry point for millions of Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors seeking access to benefits, healthcare, services, and information. As the front door to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), VA.gov plays a critical role in how Veterans understand, navigate, and trust VA programs. The effectiveness of this platform often determines Veterans' ability to access earned benefits, manage healthcare needs, and engage with VA services without unnecessary delay.
Over time, VA.gov has grown to integrate a wide range of services, legacy systems, and user journeys. While this evolution has expanded functionality, it has also increased technical complexity and operational dependencies. Veterans increasingly expect seamless, intuitive, and secure digital experiences comparable to those provided by leading private-sector platforms. Meeting these expectations reduces friction and confusion, particularly for Veterans including those with disabilities, limited digital literacy, or constrained access to technology.
Replacing VA.gov is therefore not solely a technical modernization effort, but a mission-critical initiative to improve Veteran outcomes. A modern, resilient platform enables clear navigation and more consistent identity and authentication experiences, while strengthening accessibility and information delivery. These capabilities are essential to continuity of service while supporting the diverse and evolving needs of the Veteran community across benefit portfolios and life events.
A thoughtfully planned replacement also positions VA to sustain and improve digital service delivery over the long term. By modernizing the underlying platform, VA can better adapt to policy changes, emerging technologies, and future Veteran expectations without disrupting access to critical services. Ultimately, replacing VA.gov supports VA's commitment to delivering a secure, Veteran-centric digital experience that reinforces trust, improves engagement, and ensures Veterans can reliably access the benefits and services they have earned.
Cognitive Experience Addressing Comparable VA Digital Challenges: Cognitive has experience supporting Veteran-facing digital environments where scale, security, governance, and service continuity are everyday operational concerns. Across VA programs, Cognitive has worked on initiatives involving digital experience improvements, identity and access management integration, platform engineering, analytics, and content-driven service delivery, all within highly regulated settings. This work required regular coordination with VA governance bodies, adherence to security and accessibility requirements, and collaboration across multiple stakeholders and systems. Through these efforts, Cognitive has gained firsthand insight into the challenges of modernizing high-visibility platforms while keeping services available and reliable for Veterans and other users.
Cognitive has supported environments where legacy and modern systems must coexist, where work must be carefully sequenced to manage risk, and where delivery approaches must align to established enterprise oversight structures. In these settings, Cognitive has seen that separating capability areas helps clarify accountability and engage governance more effectively, while still allowing progress without disrupting live operations.

Recommended Modular Acquisition Approach: Cognitive recommends that the VA structure the VA.gov Replacement Model effort as a series of smaller, modular contracts aligned to discrete capability areas and governed through existing VA enterprise oversight mechanisms. This recommendation is informed by Cognitive's experience supporting VA digital platforms and enterprise modernization efforts where separating experience, identity, platform, and operational capabilities enabled clearer governance alignment and reduced delivery risk. The scope described in this request spans multiple enterprise domains, including Veteran experience, identity and access management (IAM), platform engineering, content operations, analytics, and operating models. Each of these domains requires different skills, technologies, and operational approaches. These domains are already subject to separate governance bodies, technical authorities, and compliance requirements within VA. Attempting to address them through a single, consolidated contract increases complexity and introduces competing priorities that can complicate oversight and execution. While modularization introduces additional coordination requirements, this approach more closely reflects how these capabilities are managed and governed within the VA enterprise today.
By separating the requirements, VA can better align each contract to the appropriate governance authorities, including Office of Information Technology (OIT) architecture review boards, cybersecurity and privacy oversight, accessibility compliance, and enterprise content governance. Contracts can be scoped to follow the review paths and approval cycles most relevant to their specific capability area, rather than forcing all work through a single governance lens. As a result, no single contract is required to absorb the burden of satisfying overlapping or competing governance objectives. It also enables more focused and timely reviews by allowing governance bodies to evaluate changes within a narrower, more familiar scope, resulting in more efficient decision-making while still maintaining compliance with VA policies and Federal requirements.
A modular contracting strategy also supports Technology Acquisition Center's (TAC) acquisition oversight model by allowing requirements to be more clearly defined, evaluated, and managed. Smaller, capability-aligned contracts enable TAC to develop acquisition strategies that reflect the maturity, complexity, and risk associated with each domain, rather than applying a uniform acquisition approach across a highly diverse technical and operational scope.
With discrete contracts, TAC can tailor contract types, evaluation criteria, and performance measures to the nature of the procurement. Exploratory or advisory efforts can be acquired differently than implementation or operational activities. This flexibility improves acquisition outcomes and reduces the likelihood of misaligned contract structures. Further, VA could sequence work in a manner consistent with governance readiness and program dependencies. Early contracts can focus on discovery, experience research, architecture definition, and identity modernization activities to establish a foundation for implementation and reduce uncertainty across the program. Experience across large Federal digital programs suggests that sequencing work in this manner helps ensure downstream implementation efforts are informed by validated requirements, approved designs, and lessons learned from earlier phases. This reduces the risk of rework, minimizes governance rejections later in the lifecycle, and supports a more deliberate and evidence-based modernization approach.
From a program control perspective, modularization improves transparency for VA leadership and governance bodies. Each contract can be independently tracked for schedule, cost, performance, and compliance, providing clearer insight into progress and risks across the VA.gov modernization

portfolio. Under this model, VA gains earlier visibility into issues and the ability to apply more targeted escalation when challenges arise. Rather than addressing problems at an aggregate program level, VA can apply corrective actions within specific capability areas, improving responsiveness and overall program stability.
This approach preserves VA's ability to adapt as policies, technologies, and enterprise priorities change over time. Modular contracts allow VA to recompete, modify, or realign individual capability areas without destabilizing the broader VA.gov ecosystem. This flexibility supports long-term sustainability, reduces vendor lock-in, and ensures ongoing alignment with VA governance and mission needs.
Rationale for a Modular Acquisition Strategy: For TAC, a modular acquisition strategy significantly reduces acquisition and execution risk by preventing the consolidation of multiple high-risk domains into a single procurement. Distributing work across smaller, well-defined contracts limits the impact of delays, technical challenges, or vendor performance issues and aligns with TAC's responsibility to protect mission continuity, safeguard Veteran services, and ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources.
This approach also increases competition and market responsiveness. Smaller procurements allow TAC to engage highly specialized vendors with deep expertise in areas such as identity proofing, accessibility, digital analytics, platform engineering, and content operations capabilities that are essential to VA.gov but often underrepresented in large, bundled awards. Increased competition drives higher-quality solutions and improves overall value for the Government.
From a governance and compliance perspective, modular contracting streamlines oversight activities. Security authorizations, privacy assessments, Section 508 validation, and architecture reviews can be scoped and executed at the appropriate level for each capability area. This reduces review bottlenecks, shortens approval timelines, and enables governance bodies to focus on meaningful risk rather than managing overly broad accreditation boundaries.
Modularization also improves cost transparency and fiscal control. Discrete contracts allow TAC and VA leadership to better understand cost drivers, evaluate return on investment (ROI) by capability area, and make informed trade-off decisions as priorities evolve. This structure supports more precise budgeting and reduces the likelihood of uncontrolled scope growth across a large, multi-year effort. At the same time, smaller contracts provide VA with significantly greater contractual flexibility. TAC can adjust scope, sequencing, or performance expectations for individual capability areas without requiring large-scale contract modifications or renegotiation of a single award. This flexibility enables VA to pause, accelerate, recompete, or realign work based on performance, funding availability, governance direction, or emerging Veteran needs while maintaining continuity of service across VA.gov and avoiding long-term vendor lock-in.
This acquisition approach supports incremental delivery and continuous improvement, which are essential for a high-visibility, Veteran-facing digital platform. Modular contracts encourage shorter delivery cycles, clearer accountability, and faster incorporation of Veteran feedback, all while operating within VA's established governance framework. Collectively, these benefits position VA and TAC to modernize VA.gov in a controlled, adaptable, and Veteran-centric way.
Government Benefits of a Modular Contracting Model: A modular contracting approach offers significant benefits to the VA by aligning acquisition structure with the complexity, risk profile,

and governance environment of the VA.gov Replacement Model. The scope described in this request spans multiple distinct capability areas, each with specialized technical requirements, regulatory considerations, and operational impacts. Structuring the effort into smaller, capabilityaligned contracts enables VA to manage this complexity in a controlled and deliberate manner while maintaining continuity of service for Veterans and other stakeholders.
One of the primary benefits of modularization is improved risk management. Large, consolidated procurements inherently aggregate technical, schedule, security, and integration risks into a single execution path which can be difficult to unwind once execution begins. When challenges arise, their impact can cascade across unrelated areas of work. By distributing responsibilities across multiple contracts, VA can isolate risks within individual capability domains and apply targeted mitigation strategies without disrupting the broader modernization effort. This risk isolation is particularly important for a mission-critical, highly visible platform such as VA.gov, where service interruptions or delays can directly affect Veteran access to benefits and information.
Modular contracting also enhances alignment with VA's enterprise governance framework. VA.gov operates under multiple oversight bodies responsible for cybersecurity, privacy, accessibility, enterprise architecture, and content governance. Smaller, well-scoped contracts allow each capability area to follow the appropriate governance pathway and review cadence. This reduces approval bottlenecks, avoids unnecessary coupling between unrelated governance concerns, and enables timely decision-making while maintaining statutory and policy compliance.
From an acquisition perspective, modularization improves competition and market access. Smaller contracts lower barriers to entry for vendors with specialized expertise in areas such as IAM, accessibility engineering, analytics, digital experience design, or large-scale content operations. This broader participation increases VA's ability to access best-in-class solutions for each capability area rather than relying on a single vendor to provide coverage across all domains. Increased competition supports better value, innovation, and solution quality for the Government.
Cost transparency and fiscal control are additional benefits. Discrete contracts provide clearer visibility into cost drivers, performance outcomes, and ROI by capability area. This allows VA leadership to make more informed budgeting and prioritization decisions, align funding with mission needs, and reduce uncontrolled scope growth. VA can adjust investment levels incrementally as requirements mature rather than committing significant, all-in resources up front.
A modular approach further provides greater contractual flexibility over the life of the modernization effort. Individual contracts can be modified, paused, accelerated, or recompeted based on performance, funding availability, governance direction, or evolving Veteran needs without requiring large-scale renegotiation of a single award. This flexibility allows VA to remain responsive to policy changes, emerging technologies, and user feedback while retaining control over the long-term evolution of VA.gov and avoiding vendor lock-in.
Incremental delivery and continuous improvement are also enabled. Smaller contracts encourage shorter delivery cycles, clearer accountability, and earlier realization of value. VA can pilot solutions, validate assumptions, and incorporate Veteran feedback before scaling capabilities across the platform. This iterative approach supports evidence-based decision-making and reduces the risk of late-stage redesign or rework.

Modularization supports long-term sustainability of the VA.gov ecosystem. By treating the platform as a collection of evolving capabilities rather than a single static system, VA can adapt more effectively to future mission demands, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. This approach balances modernization with operational stability and positions VA to deliver a resilient, Veteran-centric digital experience over time.
A modular contracting approach creates meaningful opportunities to increase small business and Veteran-owned participation by breaking the VA.gov Replacement Model effort into smaller, well-defined capability areas. Smaller scopes reduce barriers to entry associated with large, consolidated procurements and allow firms with specialized expertise to compete for work aligned to their core competencies. This structure supports participation by Service-Disabled VeteranOwned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs), Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs), and other small businesses that may not have the capacity to prime a single, large, enterprise-wide contract.
Modularization also enables VA to apply tailored small business strategies to individual capability areas. Certain domains, such as user experience research, accessibility testing, content operations, analytics, or security support, are well suited for small business or Veteran-owned set-asides. By aligning contract scope with market capabilities, VA can more effectively leverage socioeconomic programs while still meeting technical and performance requirements. This targeted approach allows VA to balance competition, risk, and mission needs without imposing unnecessary constraints across unrelated areas of work.
A modular acquisition strategy supports sustained small business participation over time rather than limiting involvement to subcontracting roles under a single prime. Smaller contracts can be competed independently, recompeted as requirements evolve, and sequenced to align with small business capacity and performance. This promotes long-term vendor diversity, supports Veteran entrepreneurship, and aligns with VA's statutory goals to maximize Veteran-owned small business engagement while maintaining flexibility and control over the VA.gov modernization effort.
Considerations for Implementing a Modular Contracting Model: To implement a modular contracting strategy, VA could begin by defining clear capability boundaries aligned to the major functional domains described in the VA.gov Replacement Model. These domains may include, but are not limited to, user experience and service design, IAM, platform and infrastructure architecture, content strategy and operations, analytics, and governance and operating models. Establishing clear boundaries early enables VA to scope requirements around outcomes, responsibilities, and measurable value rather than organizational constructs or preferred technologies.
As part of this initial structuring, VA could document interdependencies between capability areas to inform sequencing and integration planning. While contracts would be scoped independently, identifying shared services, data flows, and integration touchpoints early helps prevent duplication and ensures modular efforts collectively support a unified VA.gov experience. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for including representatives from different modules, or capability areas, can be determined and upheld in share program increment (PI) planning meetings. This dependency mapping supports informed acquisition planning and reduces downstream integration risk.
VA could next prioritize capability areas based on mission risk, technical dependency, and readiness. Foundational activities such as discovery, user research, experience definition, identity modernization, and enterprise architecture planning could be addressed through early contracts

that establish the baseline for subsequent implementation efforts. Prioritization ensures that critical enablers are in place before higher-risk or more complex capabilities are introduced. Sequencing work in this manner allows VA to validate assumptions and reduce uncertainty early in the modernization lifecycle. Outputs from foundational contracts can inform refined requirements, governance approvals, and technical standards for later efforts, helping ensure that downstream implementation is grounded in validated designs and enterprise-aligned decisions.
For each capability area, VA could tailor acquisition strategies to the specific risk profile, scope, and maturity of the work. Some contracts may focus on exploratory or advisory activities, while others may emphasize implementation, integration, or operational sustainment. This tailoring allows VA to select appropriate contract types, periods of performance, and evaluation criteria that reflect the nature of the work rather than applying a uniform approach across all domains. Evaluation criteria and performance measures could be aligned to outcomes relevant to each capability area, such as usability improvements, security posture enhancements, content accuracy, or operational efficiency. This alignment improves accountability and enables VA to assess success based on tangible results rather than generalized program metrics.
Governance integration would be addressed by aligning each contract with the appropriate VA oversight bodies and review processes. Security, privacy, accessibility, enterprise architecture, and content governance reviews could be scoped to the specific capabilities under each contract rather than applied broadly across the entire VA.gov ecosystem. This targeted alignment reduces review complexity and supports more timely approvals while maintaining compliance with VA policies and Federal requirements.
To maintain coherence across modular efforts, program management and integration could be supported through a centralized coordination function. This function would establish shared standards, reference architecture, interface definitions, and data requirements to ensure interoperability across vendors and capability areas. Central coordination enables independent execution while preserving consistent platform vision. This could also support consolidated reporting, risk management, and dependency tracking across the modernization portfolio. By maintaining visibility into cross-contract dependencies and risks, VA can proactively manage issues spanning multiple capability areas without constraining individual contract execution.
VA could implement continuous assessment and adjustment mechanisms across modular contracts. Performance data, user feedback, and governance outcomes could be used to refine scopes, adjust sequencing, or recompete individual capability areas as requirements evolve. This iterative management approach allows VA to retain control, respond to changing priorities, and sustain modernization momentum while delivering a stable, Veteran-centric digital platform.
Managing and Governing a Modular Approach: Managing a modular VA.gov Replacement Model effort would be well served by using a SAFe Agile approach, particularly given that many VA leaders and staff are already familiar with SAFe concepts and ways of working. Rather than introducing a new management model, SAFe provides a common structure VA already understands for coordinating multiple teams, vendors, and capability areas. Using a familiar framework helps reduce friction, supports consistent execution, and gives program, technical, and leadership stakeholders a shared way to plan, track, and adjust work.
In a modular contracting environment, SAFe Agile can act as the connective tissue that keeps independently scoped contracts aligned to a shared mission and roadmap. Program Increment (PI)

planning and a synchronized cadence give vendors regular opportunities to coordinate plans, surface dependencies, and adjust priorities without centralizing day-to-day execution. This allows work to move forward independently while still providing VA with clear visibility into progress, risks, and cross-cutting impacts.
SAFe also strengthens how risk and dependencies are managed across contracts. By emphasizing incremental delivery, frequent integration, and regular inspection and adaptation, issues are more likely to surface early, when they are easier to address. Cross-contract dependencies can be identified during PI planning and routine synchronization events, helping VA manage integration risks before they become late-stage problems. This approach fits naturally with modular acquisition by keeping independent efforts aligned to shared architectural standards and operational constraints.
Change management and governance can be handled in a more practical and predictable way under a SAFe model. Backlog refinement, reviews, and planned milestones create natural points for engaging security, privacy, accessibility, and architecture stakeholders. Instead of layering on separate management processes, governance activities can be integrated into an established cadence, helping VA maintain compliance while reducing unnecessary administrative overhead and delays.
From a performance standpoint, a SAFe enabled modular approach keeps the focus on outcomes rather than activity. Measures such as delivered features, readiness, quality, and value provide leadership with a clearer picture of how the program is performing across contracts. This visibility supports timely decision-making, targeted intervention when issues arise, and ongoing improvement as the program evolves.
Combining modular contracting with a SAFe Agile management approach gives VA a practical way to manage a complex, multi-vendor modernization effort. It aligns well with VA's existing training and operating culture, supports effective oversight and governance, and allows progress to continue in a controlled, adaptable manner, while keeping continuity of service for Veterans and other users front and center.
Maintaining Continuity of Service During Modernization: A modular contracting approach supports continuity of service by avoiding large, disruptive platform cutovers that place missioncritical services at risk. Rather than replacing VA.gov through a single, enterprise-wide transition, modularization enables VA to modernize discrete capability areas independently while the broader platform remains operational. This structure reduces the likelihood that issues in one domain will propagate across the entire user experience and interrupt access for Veterans, caregivers, and other stakeholders.
By sequencing work across foundational and downstream capability areas, VA can introduce changes incrementally and validate performance before scaling. Early efforts can focus on discovery, experience definition, architecture planning, and identity modernization without altering live user pathways. Subsequent implementations can then be deployed in controlled phases, informed by approved designs and operational readiness assessments. This phased execution model allows VA to manage transitions deliberately, minimizing user disruption while maintaining stable access to benefits and services.

Modularization also enables more effective operational risk management during modernization. Because each contract is scoped to a specific capability area, changes can be tested, deployed, and monitored within defined boundaries. If issues arise, corrective actions can be applied locally without requiring system-wide rollbacks or emergency interventions. This containment capability is critical for a high-traffic platform like VA.gov, where even brief outages can have significant downstream impacts on Veterans seeking time-sensitive information or services.
The recommended approach strengthens continuity of service by preserving VA's ability to adapt in real time. Modular contracts allow VA to adjust sequencing, pause deployments, or realign work based on performance data, user feedback, or emerging operational needs. This flexibility ensures that modernization activities remain subordinate to service availability, enabling VA to prioritize uninterrupted access while steadily advancing toward a more modern, resilient, and Veterancentric digital platform.
Integrating Legacy and Modern Systems Without Disruption: A modular contracting approach enables VA to integrate with a diverse portfolio of legacy and emerging systems without introducing unnecessary coupling or systemic risk. By scoping contracts around discrete capability areas rather than end-to-end platform replacement, VA can design and implement integrations that respect existing system boundaries, data ownership, and operational constraints. This approach reduces the likelihood that changes in one system will cascade across the broader ecosystem, supporting stable interoperability while modernization progresses.
Modularization supports the use of standardized integration patterns that can be applied consistently across both legacy and modern systems. Shared interface definitions, data exchange standards, and API-based integration models allow new capabilities to interact with existing systems without requiring wholesale refactoring. This is particularly important in an environment where mission-critical legacy systems must continue operating alongside newer cloud-based services and emerging digital capabilities.
By separating integration responsibilities across capability-aligned contracts, VA can tailor integration strategies to the technical maturity of each system. Legacy systems with limited flexibility can be integrated through controlled, well-understood interfaces, while newer systems can leverage more dynamic, service-oriented approaches. This differentiation allows VA to modernize incrementally while preserving the reliability of systems that cannot be easily modified.
The modular approach also improves governance and oversight of system integrations. Integration activities can be reviewed, tested, and approved within the scope of each contract, aligned to relevant architecture, security, and data governance authorities. This targeted oversight reduces approval bottlenecks and ensures integrations meet enterprise standards without delaying unrelated modernization activities.
Modularization positions VA to evolve its integration landscape over time. As legacy systems are modernized or retired and new systems are introduced, individual integration components can be updated or replaced without disrupting the broader platform. This adaptability supports long-term interoperability, reduces technical debt, and enables VA.gov to function as a resilient, extensible digital front door across a continually evolving system environment.
Operating Within VA's Regulated and High-Visibility Environment: This type of operation requires an approach that balances innovation with control, transparency, and accountability. The

Page 8

Department of Veterans Affairs Replacement Model for VA.gov Sources Sought 36C10B26Q0131
recommended modular contracting strategy supports this balance by aligning modernization activities to VA's established governance structures rather than attempting to bypass or consolidate them. By structuring work into discrete capability areas, VA can ensure that each effort proceeds in accordance with applicable policies, statutory requirements, and oversight expectations while maintaining clear lines of responsibility.
A modular approach enables regulatory and compliance activities to be scoped appropriately and executed in a deliberate manner. Security, privacy, accessibility, and enterprise architecture reviews can be planned and conducted at milestones relevant to each capability area rather than applied uniformly across the entire VA.gov ecosystem. This targeted alignment reduces review complexity, shortens approval timelines, and supports more effective risk management while maintaining compliance with Federal regulations and VA policies.
Given the high visibility of VA.gov, the ability to manage change carefully is critical. Modularization allows VA to introduce changes incrementally, assess impacts, and address issues before they affect a broad user population. Because each contract operates within defined boundaries, VA can contain and resolve issues quickly without escalating them into enterprisewide incidents, preserving public trust and confidence in the platform.
The recommended approach also enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a public-facing Federal environment. Modular contracts provide clearer insight into scope, performance, cost, and compliance by capability area, enabling VA leadership and oversight bodies to monitor progress and risks more effectively. This transparency supports informed decision-making and strengthens oversight without imposing unnecessary administrative burden.
Operating in a regulated environment requires adaptability to evolving policies, standards, and external scrutiny. Modular contracts provide VA with the flexibility to adjust scope, sequencing, or acquisition strategies as regulatory requirements or priorities change, without destabilizing ongoing operations. This adaptability allows VA to remain compliant and responsive while continuing to deliver reliable, Veteran-centric digital services through VA.gov.
Enabling Long-Term Scalability, Adaptability, and Resilience: A modular contracting approach supports long-term scalability by VA.gov to evolve as a collection of interoperable capability areas rather than a single, tightly coupled system. By establishing clear boundaries between functions such as identity, content, experience, analytics, and platform services, VA can scale individual components based on demand without over-provisioning or redesigning the entire environment. This targeted scalability allows VA to respond efficiently to changes in user volume, usage patterns, or mission demands while maintaining stable operations across the broader platform.
Adaptability is strengthened through the ability to evolve capability areas independently as policies, technologies, and Veteran expectations change. Modular contracts allow VA to update, replace, or enhance specific functions without forcing wholesale platform redesign or long-term dependency on a single solution. Through this approach, VA can incorporate emerging technologies, adopt improved service delivery models, and respond to regulatory or policy changes in a controlled manner, ensuring VA.gov remains relevant and responsive over time.
Resilience is enhanced by reducing systemic risk and limiting the blast radius of failures. With discrete capability areas managed and deployed independently, issues in one domain can be

Page 9

Department of Veterans Affairs Replacement Model for VA.gov Sources Sought 36C10B26Q0131
isolated and addressed without disrupting unrelated services. This containment capability supports operational stability, reduces recovery time, and enables VA to maintain service during incidents, upgrades, or transitions. Modularization also simplifies testing, monitoring, and recovery planning by allowing resilience measures to be tailored to the specific risk profile of each capability area.
Cognitive's recommended approach supports long-term resilience by enabling continuous improvement and proactive risk management. Incremental delivery, performance monitoring, and governance-aligned oversight allow VA to identify emerging issues early and adjust before they impact users at scale. Over time, this adaptive operating model strengthens VA's ability to sustain a secure, scalable, and reliable digital platform that can withstand evolving operational, technical, and policy challenges while continuing to serve millions of Veterans and stakeholders.
Conclusion and Path Forward: Replacing VA.gov represents a mission-critical opportunity to strengthen how the VA delivers user-centric services to Veterans, their families, caregivers, and other stakeholders. As VA's primary digital front door, the platform must continue to operate reliably at scale while adapting to evolving mission demands, policies, and technologies. The modular contracting approach described in this response aligns modernization activities with VA's existing governance structures, acquisition oversight model, and operational realities, ensuring that progress does not come at the expense of service availability.
By separating the VA.gov Replacement Model into capability-aligned contracts, VA can reduce risk, maintain continuity of service, and exercise greater control over sequencing, performance, and outcomes. This approach enables incremental modernization, supports competition and small business participation, and preserves flexibility as requirements mature. Taken together, these attributes position VA to modernize VA.gov in a deliberate, transparent, and Veteran-centric manner, ensuring the platform remains secure, resilient, and responsive to the needs of millions of users over the long term.
