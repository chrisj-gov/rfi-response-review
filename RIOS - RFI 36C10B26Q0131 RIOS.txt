over time. Rios has demonstrated this capability by serving as integrator for large, complex VA efforts, including managing VHA's IHT 1.0 IDIQ for more than five years. In that role, Rios coordinated over 60 subcontracting partners, deployed more than 180 staff across 26 task orders, and delivered over $50M in work with consistently strong CPARS performance. This experience positions Team Rios to support a progressive VA.gov replacement model by assembling, scaling, and adjusting multidisciplinary teams as VA's needs evolve while maintaining continuity of service, balanced vendor participation, and delivery accountability.
Deep Familiarity with VA, VHA, and Innovation Ecosystems
VA's RFI makes clear that replacing VA.gov is not only a technical challenge, but an organizational one that requires understanding how decisions are made, how change travels, and where friction exists within VA. Rios brings deep, firsthand experience working with VA and innovation organizations, including close collaboration with internal stakeholders across the field network and headquarters. Our team has experience analyzing integration dependencies and sequencing modernization of systems such as MAPD, EVSS, and eBenefits residuals. We understand that VA.gov modernization must account for dualrun periods, contracttested API boundaries, and Authoritative Data Source requirements such as the Master Person Index and other VA enterprise systems.
Rios' work supporting initiatives such as the VA Pathfinder project, a humancentered, digital intake and routing platform that helps VA identify, evaluate, and connect with promising innovations and vendors. Rios helped evolve it from a limited external innovation effort into a scalable internal and external engagement model demonstrates an understanding of how innovation must be adapted to VA's culture, governance, and operational realities. This familiarity enables Rios to deliver value immediately, without a lengthy onboarding curve.
Cost Conscious Delivery Without Compromising Quality-Conscious Delivery Without Compromising Quality
VA must modernize under real fiscal constraints. Rios' longstanding integrator role has required building and managing high performing teams while controlling cost. Rios achieves this through low overhead subcontractor management, standardized operating procedures, and use of internally developed tools (such as the Rios Delta ERP) designed specifically for consulting and contract execution. In addition, Rios' provides access to a broad range of labor categories at rates favorable to the government supporting VA's need for flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency throughout a multiyear VA.gov transition standing integrator role has required building and managing high-performing teams while controlling cost. Rios achieves this through low overhead subcontractor management, standardized operating procedures, and use of internally developed tools (such as the Rios Delta ERP) designed specifically for consulting and multi-year VA.gov transition.
Ability to Translate Innovation into Scalable, Operational Outcomes
VA's RFI emphasizes the need for approaches that move beyond experimentation to sustained, enterprise impact. Rios brings demonstrated expertise in identifying valuable innovations and

helping organizations implement effective solutions. Rios has supported VA in developing and scaling prototypes and in applying structured innovation frameworks tailored to VA's operating environment, e.g. VA Pathfinder digital platform, Pathfinder Vendor Track prototype, Pathfinder Innovator Tracks. This experience supports VA's goal of ensuring that a next generation VA.gov is not only modern at launch, but able to evolve, scale, and deliver measurable value over time. Next generation VA.gov is not only modern at launch, but able to evolve, scale, and deliver measurable value over time.
Strength in Change Management, Transparency, and Enterprise Alignment
A decentralized organization like VA requires more than technology to succeed it requires alignment, visibility, and trust. Rios has extensive experience managing large PMOs across diverse programs and driving shared accountability through metrics, analytics, and transparent reporting. Rios applies proven program and change management approaches (including PMI PMBOK and PROSCI ADKAR) to ensure that transformation efforts remain aligned with strategic objectives and are absorbed by the organization. This capability is directly relevant to VA's need to modernize VA.gov while breaking down silos, coordinating across benefit portfolios, and ensuring a consistent Veteran experience. We welcome the opportunity to engage in follow-on discussions, technical exchanges, or pilot initiatives as the VA assesses future strategies for VA.gov replacement.
2 OVERVIEW OF WORK
VA.gov has undergone multiple waves of modernization over the past two decades, beginning with largescale web consolidation efforts as early as 2009, when VA initiated a departmentwide redesign to simplify navigation, standardize branding, and improve access across hundreds of VA websites and tens of thousands of pages. These efforts laid the groundwork for later consolidation into VA.gov as a central Veteranfacing digital entry point.
Team Rios will assist the VA in providing a modern, secure, and Veteran-focused VA.gov experience, serving as the primary gateway for Veterans, their families, and other stakeholders to access benefits, healthcare, services, and information. We recognize that replacing VA.gov necessitates not only technical updates but also comprehensive modernization spanning design, platform architecture, digital identity, navigation, content strategy, governance, analytics, and operational models. These enhancements must ensure uninterrupted service, seamless integration with diverse systems, and adherence to federal regulations. Team Rios demonstrates the proficiency and comprehensive experience necessary to effectively meet these requirements.
Our approach emphasizes transformation that explicitly identifies, prioritizes, and mitigates risks to improve the Veteran digital experience while sustaining operations: modernizing identity, sign in, and navigation flows; strengthening enterprise content strategy and governance; and enabling scalable, resilient delivery practices suitable for long-term adaptability, sign-in, and navigation flows; strengthening enterprise content strategy and governance; and enabling scalable, resilient delivery practices suitable for long-term adaptability.

3 UNDERSTANDING OF VA'S CHALLENGE
Team Rios recognizes that replacing VA.gov is a complex, multi-year transformation requiring both ongoing service and innovation. As the main digital gateway for Veterans' benefits, healthcare, and services, modernization must ensure continuous access while adapting the platform to evolving needs. Key challenges we recognize include the need to integrate legacy, hybrid, and cloud native systems across one of the federal government's most complex IT environments, while modernizing identity, sign in, and navigation experiences in ways that reduce friction without disrupting trusted user workflows. We recognize that these changes must be delivered incrementally, with careful risk management, to avoid service degradation or loss of user trust.
We also understand that VA.gov operates within a highly regulated, highly visible environment, requiring strict adherence to federal security, privacy, and accessibility requirements, including FISMA and Section 508, while supporting long-term scalability, resilience, and adaptability. Accessibility and compliance are not parallel efforts, but foundational requirements that must be integrated into design, development, and operations.
Finally, we recognize VA's priority to coordinate experience design, platform architecture, content strategy, analytics, and governance at scale. Sustainable improvement to VA.gov requires aligned operating models, clear ownership, and enterprise governance structures that enable consistent decision making across distributed stakeholders, while still allowing innovation and responsiveness to Veteran needs. Facilitating coordination among distributed stakeholders while enabling innovation and responsiveness to Veterans' needs.
We recommend a progressive replacement model rather than a single "big bang" rebuild, allowing VA to modernize VA.gov while maintaining continuity of service and reducing enterprise risk. Our approach is grounded in incremental migration with backward compatibility, supported by a modular, composable platform architecture that enables phased adoption and long- term adaptability.

Modernization is experience led and anchored in real Veteran journeys, ensuring that changes to identity, sign in, navigation, and content improve usability without disrupting trusted workflows. From day one, we will emphasize strong governance and observability, supported by analytics and feedback loops that enable continuous learning, informed decision making, and ongoing improvement.
4 EXPERIENCE DESIGN & VETERAN CENTRICITY-CENTRICITY
VA's July 2025 OIG audit found only 4 of 30 critical IT systems classified as Section 508 compliant, and a 2021 report to Congress showed 9% of internet sites and 6% of intranet sites meeting full compliance which threatens the credibility of modernization efforts. 1Team Rios recommends that accessibility be treated as the load-bearing architectural requirement for the replacement platform, not a compliance afterthought validated at the end of development.
4.1 ACCESSIBILITY AS A FIRST-CLASS ENGINEERING CONSTRAINT
 Embed accessibility into the CI/CD pipeline, not into post-build audits: Automated accessibility testing tools (axe-core, Pa11y, Lighthouse) should execute on every pull request, with Section 508 violations treated as build-breaking defects equivalent to security vulnerabilities. The current VA approach of relying on vendor self-declarations rather than independent testing has produced the 4-of-30 compliance rate; automated gating eliminates this dependency.
 Mandate assistive technology integration testing as a release gate: VA requires a minimum of 20% of research participants to be assistive technology users, but this standard must extend to engineering validation. Every release candidate should pass structured test scripts executed with iOS Voice-over, JAWS/NVDA on Windows, and Talkback on Android before reaching production. AEM's work developing accessible open-source dynamic data visualization tools for the Department of Education's Rhonda Weiss Center for Accessible IDEA Data demonstrates this approach: screen reader compatibility, braille output fidelity, and cognitive accessibility were validated iteratively during development sprints, not deferred to acceptance testing.
 Establish an Accessibility Center of Excellence with enforcement authority: VA's OIG found that three directives related to accessibility had not been updated within required 5-year recertification periods, and contracting officers did not verify systems were accessible before procurement. The replacement model should stand up a crossfunctional team with authority to block deployments, review procurement documentation, and maintain a continuously updated accessibility posture dashboard modeled on how security operations centers track vulnerability remediation.
 Design for the full spectrum of disability, not just screen reader users: Only 45% of Veterans at VHA facilities have adequate health literacy. Accessibility must encompass cognitive, motor, and situational disabilities. This means plain-language defaults (aligned with VA Directive 0001 and the Plain Writing Act), high-contrast modes, reducedmotion options, and content that follows the `bite-snack-meal' model three to four lines of key information above the fold. AEM's Weiss Center work specifically addressed

dynamic data visualization for individuals with cognitive disabilities by minimizing complexity, simplifying language, and providing alternative modalities including speechto-text synthesis and embossed graphics for braille readers.
4.2 VETERAN-CENTRIC EXPERIENCE STRATEGY
 Replace content-centric information architecture with task-based navigation: VA's own research shows only approximately 8% of visitors use the My VA dashboard, which was designed like a content page despite serving task and tool functions. The replacement model should organize the experience around what Veterans are trying to accomplish filing a claim, scheduling an appointment, checking a payment rather than mirroring VA's organizational chart. Each task flow should be completable within a single authenticated session without requiring the veteran to navigate between separate systems.
 Adopt trauma-informed design principles across all touchpoints: Veterans navigating disability claims, mental health services, or appeals are frequently in states of cognitive and emotional stress. The Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination process was identified as the largest FY23 pain point. Interface design should minimize cognitive load, avoid punitive language, provide clear progress indicators, and offer human-assisted fallback at every critical decision point. Error messages should be instructive rather than procedural.
 Extend design validation to underserved populations with purpose-built research protocols: VA's Office of Rural Health serves 4.7 million Veterans in rural areas, 2.8 million of whom rely on VA for healthcare. Research panels must include Veterans with low bandwidth connectivity, limited device access, and low digital literacy. Remote moderated usability sessions should be supplemented with in-person site visits at CBOCs and Vet Centers in rural and tribal areas to capture experiences not visible in remote research settings.
5 IDENTITY, AUTHENTICATION, AND NAVIGATION
The completion of VA's credential migration removing My HealtheVet credentials in March 2025 and DS Logon in November 2025 simplified the authentication landscape but transferred significant complexity onto Veterans, particularly those with limited technology access. The new platform should treat authentication as a key design issue, not just routine infrastructure.
5.1 IDENTITY & SIGN-IN
 Implement tiered identity proofing pathways matched to transaction risk: Not every VA.gov interaction requires IAL2 identity verification. Browsing benefits information, downloading forms, or reading eligibility criteria should be accessible without authentication. Filing a claim or accessing health records justifies full identity proofing. A risk-based model reduces friction for low-sensitivity tasks while maintaining security for high-sensitivity transactions, and prevents the current pattern where Veterans encounter identity walls before understanding what they are trying to access.
 Build assisted identity recovery pathways for vulnerable populations: Veterans with expired IDs, no permanent address, or only a Veterans Health ID Card currently face complex recovery processes video calls with additional documentation, USPS or UPS Store visits, or obtaining a Letter Attesting State Residency from their local medical

center. VA contact centers cannot reset Login.gov or ID.me passwords. The replacement model should integrate a VA-staffed identity help desk that can coordinate directly with credential providers, rather than directing distressed Veterans to third-party support queues.
 Resolve MPI/MVI identity fragmentation as a precondition for personalized experience: The Master Person Index contains over 75 million records with ongoing duplicate ICN resolution challenges and EDIPI-to-ICN crossover problems. GAO found that DoD's system was overwriting VA identity and demographics information in the Oracle Health EHR a patient safety concern. The replacement platform's personalization features (task status, claim tracking, health records) are only as reliable as the identity resolution layer beneath them. Investment in identity data quality must precede or parallel experience development, not follow it.
5.2 NAVIGATION
 Eliminate the content-maze pattern with a unified task orchestration layer: Veterans currently navigate between hundreds of phone numbers and thousands of websites, with confusion between VA.gov, eBenefits (legacy), and My HealtheVet. The replacement model should provide a single navigational framework where Veterans can access any benefit, service, or status from one authenticated starting point, with contextual routing to the correct backend system handled invisibly.
 Provide proactive status and next-step guidance without requiring veteran-initiated queries: Rather than requiring Veterans to log in and navigate to check claim status or appointment confirmations, the platform should push relevant status updates via VA Notify/VEText (already in production at $43M contract value) and present a personalized dashboard that surfaces the most time-sensitive items first upcoming appointments, pending actions, recent decisions above the fold upon login.
 Maintain cross-device session continuity with graceful degradation: Many Veterans begin a process on a mobile device and complete it on a desktop, or vice versa. Session state should persist across devices within a reasonable window. For Veterans using flip phones or devices with limited browser capabilities, the platform should gracefully degrade to SMS-based workflows for critical tasks like appointment confirmation and prescription refill, ensuring no veteran is excluded by device limitations.
6 PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE & INTEGRATION
The current VA.gov architecture consists of a React/Redux frontend, Ruby on Rails backend, Drupal 10 CMS, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Sidekiq, all operating within AWS GovCloud. This modern technology stack has undergone incremental enhancements since 2016. Team Rios' proposed replacement model will leverage this established foundation rather than replace it entirely, following the progressive upgrade approach that the VA adopted after experiences with the Oracle Health EHR deployment.
6.1 ARCHITECTURAL MODEL
 Adopt an experience orchestration layer to decouple veteran-facing services from backend complexity: The current architecture requires the vets-api Rails backend to maintain direct integration adapters for each legacy system (VistA, VBMS, EVSS,

02/05/2026 / RFQ #: 36C10B26Q0131 RFI - Replacement Model for VA.gov
CorpDB, BGS). An orchestration layer implemented as a lightweight API gateway with service mesh capabilities would allow backend systems to be retired, replaced, or upgraded independently of the frontend experience, reducing the blast radius of any single system change.
 Extend the VA Lighthouse API platform as the canonical integration surface: Lighthouse (developer.va.gov) already provides the `single, secure front door' to VA data and has been praised by industry analysts as offering the best API integration experience among healthcare payers. The replacement model should require all new integrations internal and external to be published through Lighthouse, enforcing consistent authentication, rate limiting, versioning, and documentation standards. This prevents the proliferation of point-to-point integrations that created the current technical debt.
 Resolve the content publishing latency problem through event-driven architecture: The current Drupal CMS requires a build process with scheduled deploys running daily at 2pm ET, with off-schedule deploys available only via Jenkins for urgent updates. For a platform serving millions of Veterans during health emergencies, benefit deadline changes, or policy updates, this delay is operationally unacceptable. AEM's modernization of EDFacts for the Department of Education replaced a decades-old transactional system with an event-driven architecture in AWS that eliminated batch processing delays and enabled near-real-time data availability. A similar pattern using event-driven content delivery with CDN cache invalidation would allow VA content updates to reach Veterans within minutes rather than hours.
6.2 INTEGRATION STRATEGY
 Sequence legacy system retirement by usage data and risk exposure, not organizational preference: VA's goal of reducing 3,000+ daily legacy system users by September 2025 requires a data-driven retirement sequence. Each legacy system (MAPD, portions of EVSS, eBenefits residuals) should be assessed on three dimensions: active user volume, integration dependency count, and security risk posture. Systems with high security exposure and low user counts should retire first; high-volume systems need parallel-run periods with automated traffic shifting.
 Implement contract-tested integration boundaries to prevent upstream/downstream regression: With 594+ contributors on the vets-website repository and 45+ product teams building on the VA Design System, integration failures are a primary source of production incidents. Consumer-driven contract testing (using frameworks like Pact) at each API boundary ensures that changes to any system's contract are detected before deployment, not in production. AEM's management of 1,100+ business rules in the EDPass data validation engine for the Department of Education demonstrates how centralized rule governance at integration boundaries prevents data quality degradation across a multi-stakeholder ecosystem.
 Plan for Oracle Health EHR coexistence with clear data sovereignty boundaries: With only 6 of 170 VA medical centers deployed on Oracle Health and resumption planned mid-2026, the replacement VA.gov must maintain dual integration paths VistA and Oracle Health for the foreseeable future. Team Rios' architectural model treats EHR integration as a pluggable adapter, not a hardcoded dependency, so that deployment progress (or regression) in the EHR program does not constrain the VA.gov experience.

02/05/2026 / RFQ #: 36C10B26Q0131 RFI - Replacement Model for VA.gov
7 CONTENT STRATEGY, GOVERNANCE, AND ANALYTICS
VA operates at least four content management systems in production (Drupal, WordPress VIP, OpenText TeamSite, SharePoint) with content governance flowing through a Web Governance Board co-chaired by two Assistant Secretaries and three separate Web Communications Offices. This governance complexity is a greater barrier to content quality than any technology limitation.
7.1 CONTENT STRATEGY
 Establish a federated content model with centralized standards and decentralized authoring: Team Rios will propose a replacement platform that does not attempt to consolidate all content into a single Content Management System (CMS). Instead, Team Rios will enforce a single content API contract schema, metadata taxonomy, accessibility requirements, plain language standards that any publishing system must satisfy to surface content on VA.gov. This allows VHA, VBA, and NCA to maintain domain-appropriate authoring workflows while ensuring Veterans see a unified experience.
 Implement content lifecycle management with automated staleness detection: Federal content frequently becomes outdated because no system enforces review cycles. Every content object should carry a review-by date, an accountable owner, and an automated escalation path. Content that exceeds its review window should be flagged for the owning Web Communications Office, and content exceeding a hard expiration threshold should be automatically deprioritized in search and navigation. Team Rios' governance model for data collections incorporates data quality standards and review cycles directly into the collection process, providing a dependable framework.
 Deploy AI-assisted content optimization with mandatory human review: VA's 2024 AI Use Case Inventory identifies 227 use cases, including a generative AI chat interface where 72%+ report improved efficiency. For content, AI can identify reading-level violations, suggest plain-language alternatives, flag accessibility gaps in alt text or heading structure, and detect duplicate content across VA's thousands of pages. All AIgenerated suggestions must route through human editorial review before publication, with the AI acting as a quality assurance accelerator rather than a content generator.
7.2 ANALYTICS & MEASUREMENT
 Shift from page-level analytics to end-to-end journey measurement: VA's current analytics stack (GA360, Domo, GTM, BigQuery) is instrumented primarily at the page level. The replacement model should measure complete veteran journeys from initial search or notification through task completion to identify where Veterans abandon processes, encounter errors, or resort to phone calls. Journey-level data, combined with VSignals feedback (3+ million veteran responses to date), enables identification of systemic experience failures rather than individual page performance.
 Tie experience metrics to mission outcomes, not vanity metrics: Downloads, page views, and session duration do not measure whether a veteran successfully filed a claim, enrolled in healthcare, or accessed their records. The replacement platform should define a limited set of outcome metrics task completion rate, time-to-completion, error-driven abandonment rate, and channel escalation rate (digital to phone) and track these at the journey level. These outcome metrics should be the basis for product team prioritization and investment decisions.

02/05/2026 / RFQ #: 36C10B26Q0131 RFI - Replacement Model for VA.gov
 Implement identity-aware analytics with strong privacy controls: Understanding whether the same veteran is repeatedly failing to complete a task (indicating a systemic UX problem) versus whether many Veterans fail once (indicating a content clarity problem) requires identity-aware session stitching. This must operate within Privacy Act, HIPAA, and E-Government Act guardrails using Privacy Impact Assessments, pseudonymized identifiers, and aggregate-only external reporting but analytical capability is essential for targeted improvement.
8 SECURITY, COMPLIANCE, AND OPERATIONS
VA's FISMA audit has kept 23 of 26 recommendations active since 2018. GAO found a highrisk vulnerability unresolved for over 15 months. The February 2024 ransomware attack exposed 1.2 million Veterans. These issues point to a focus on compliance over effective security, which the replacement model must directly address.
8.1 SECURITY BY DESIGN
 Implement zero-trust architecture from the foundation, not as a retrofit: VA's $331 million Cybersecurity Operations Center Next Generation II contract provides enterprise monitoring and incident response. The replacement platform should extend this capability with zero-trust principles applied at the application layer: every API call authenticated and authorized, every session validated continuously, every data access logged and attributable. This is particularly critical given the MPI's 75+ million records and the sensitivity of health and benefits data.
 Accelerate ATO through inherited authorization and continuous monitoring: VA has already demonstrated that ATO timelines can be reduced from 9-12 months to 60-90 days through FedRAMP inheritance for cloud applications. The replacement model should extend this by implementing continuous authorization where security controls are monitored in real time and ATO status is maintained through automated evidence collection rather than periodic manual assessment. Since implementing the Authorizing Official Summary Brief tool in 2018, VA has remediated over 298,000 system vulnerabilities; continuous authorization sustains this velocity without human bottlenecks.
 Require third-party vendor security posture validation as a procurement gate: The Change Healthcare incident demonstrated that VA's security perimeter extends to every third-party integration. The replacement model should require continuous vendor security posture validation not point-in-time SOC 2 reports for all systems that process, store, or transmit veteran data. This includes credential providers (Login.gov, ID.me), cloud service providers, and API consumers. AEM's management of FedRAMP-aligned security across 13 Department of Education ATOs, including ED's largest K-12 data collection systems, provides a replicable model for maintaining security compliance across a complex multi-vendor environment.
8.2 COMPLIANCE & OPERATIONS
 Integrate Section 508 compliance into the same continuous monitoring framework as security: The OIG found that VA's Section 508 compliance and security compliance fail for the same structural reason: they depend on periodic manual reviews rather than

continuous automated validation. The replacement model should treat accessibility defects and security vulnerabilities with the same severity framework tracked in the same remediation pipeline, subject to the same SLA escalation, and reported to the same governance body.
 Embed DevSecOps practices with automated compliance evidence generation: Every deployment should automatically generate compliance artifacts security scan results, accessibility test reports, dependency vulnerability assessments, and configuration drift detection stored in an auditable evidence repository. This eliminates the documentation backlog that contributes to VA's recurring FISMA findings while providing auditors with real-time access to the organization's security posture. AEM's CMMI Level 3 practices for Development and Services, combined with ISO 27001 and ISO 20000 operational maturity, provide the process discipline to sustain this model across multiple product teams.
 Establish a supply chain security program aligned with NIST SP 800-161: VA's Technical Reference Model mandates technology assessment, but the replacement model's open-source dependencies (React, Node.js, Ruby, Drupal, and their transitive dependencies) present an expanded attack surface. A software bill of materials (SBOM) should be generated for every deployment, with automated scanning for known vulnerabilities in the dependency chain. This is not optional--it is an executive order requirement and directly addresses the supply chain risk class that enabled incidents like the 2020 Financial Services Center breach.
 Plan for operational continuity during progressive replacement with dual-run capability: Any replacement of a platform serving 17.5 million monthly logins must maintain continuous availability. Team Rios' proposed operational model will support dual-run periods where legacy and replacement components operate in parallel with automated traffic shifting, real-time performance comparison, and instant rollback capability. Change management will be integrated with DevSecOps every deployment must pass through automated security, accessibility, and integration test gates before reaching production, with canary deployment patterns limiting the blast radius of any defect that passes the gates.
9 KEY TRADEOFFS AND DECISION CONSIDERATIONS
Replacing VA.gov requires deliberate choices among competing priorities. There is no approach that maximizes speed, minimizes risk, reduces cost, and modernizes every component simultaneously. Team Rios believes that making these tradeoffs explicit is essential to protecting continuity of service for Veterans while enabling long-term modernization.
Progressive Replacement vs. Speed A progressive replacement model reduces enterprise risk by allowing VA to modernize incrementally, validate changes with real users, and recover quickly when issues arise. The tradeoff is a longer transition period compared to a clean-slate rebuild. Given VA.gov's role as a mission-critical entry point for millions of Veterans, the reduced risk of service disruption and loss of trust outweighs the benefit of faster but riskier delivery.
User Friction vs. Security Rigor

02/05/2026 / RFQ #: 36C10B26Q0131 RFI - Replacement Model for VA.gov

Risk-based identity proofing lowers friction for low-risk interactions while preserving strong protections for sensitive transactions. The tradeoff is added architectural and governance complexity, requiring clear policy, consistent enforcement, and strong observability. Treating identity as a product rather than a solved infrastructure problem increases near-term effort but materially improves Veteran experience and reduces avoidable abandonment.

Central Standards vs. Local Flexibility Enterprise standards for accessibility, security, content, and analytics are necessary to deliver a consistent Veteran experience. However, excessive central control can slow delivery and limit responsiveness to local needs. The recommended model balances centralized standards and enforcement with decentralized execution, accepting coordination overhead in exchange for scalability and resilience across VA administrations.

Platform Reuse vs. Clean-Slate Rebuild Building on VA's existing modern stack preserves institutional knowledge, reduces transition risk, and avoids repeating mistakes seen in large federal "big-bang" transformations. The tradeoff is that some legacy constraints remain in the near term. A composable architecture and clear retirement roadmap mitigate this risk by enabling gradual replacement without destabilizing the platform.

Dual-Run Operations vs. Short-Term Cost Operating legacy and replacement components in parallel increases short-term operational cost and complexity. However, dual-run capability provides essential safeguards: real-time comparison, controlled traffic shifting, and immediate rollback. For a platform with high visibility and low tolerance for failure, this redundancy is an intentional investment in continuity and trust.

Vendor Flexibility vs. Accountability Allowing multiple vendors over time increases access to innovation but risks fragmented accountability. An integrator-led operating model prioritizes transparency, measurable outcomes, and enforceable quality gates. This approach accepts additional coordination effort to ensure flexibility does not come at the expense of reliability or Veteran experience.
