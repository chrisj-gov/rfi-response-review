 3. Executive Summary | Solution Overview

JourneyBlazers proposes a modern replacement model for VA.gov that transforms it from a primarily informational website into a secure, identity-enabled, Veteran-centric digital service platform. This approach uses VA's existing Salesforce Government Cloud Plus environment as a FedRAMP High-authorized enterprise digital engagement foundation, enabling VA to deliver personalized, resilient, and scalable digital experiences while preserving continuity of service.

Instead of implementing a new monolithic web platform, this approach designates Salesforce as the digital front door and orchestration layer--integrating experience, identity, service delivery, data, analytics, and backend systems into a unified Veteran experience. The solution is designed to support millions of users, operate within a highly regulated federal environment, and evolve incrementally without disrupting Veterans' access to benefits, healthcare, and services.

The proposed solution uses Salesforce as an enterprise digital engagement platform composed of six integrated layers, each addressing specific VA objectives.

4. Response to RFI Requirements

4.1 Descriptions of Relevant Ideas, Capabilities, and Approaches
JourneyBlazers proposes replacing VA.gov with a platform-based digital engagement and service orchestration model built on Salesforce Government Cloud Plus. This approach redefines VA.gov from a static, navigation-heavy website into an identity-enabled, personalized, and service-driven digital front door that adapts to Veterans' needs in real time.
Rather than requiring Veterans to understand VA's internal organizational structure, benefits portfolios, or backend systems, this model provides a "no wrong door" experience. Veterans interact with VA through a single digital entry point that understands their identity, eligibility, service history, and current context--then routes them seamlessly to the appropriate services, workflows, and resources.
Key elements of this approach include:
 Treating VA.gov as a secure service platform, not a content-only website  Using identity and data context to drive navigation, personalization, and automation  Leveraging agentic AI to guide Veterans, reduce friction, and extend service availability  Orchestrating engagement across web, mobile, messaging, and contact centers  Preserving continuity of service through phased migration and API-led integration
This approach aligns with VA's need to modernize while maintaining resilience, scalability, and trust in a highly visible federal environment.

Relevant Technologies and Architectural Approach
The proposed solution uses Salesforce as an enterprise digital engagement platform composed of six integrated layers, each addressing specific VA objectives.
Digital Experience (VA.gov Replacement)
Salesforce Experience Cloud delivers both the public VA.gov website and the authenticated Veteran portal. This enables VA to unify public information, secure transactions, and personalized services within a single experience.
Capabilities include:
 Personalized "My VA" dashboards  Guided applications and digital forms  Context-aware navigation and recommendations  Section 508-compliant, mobile-responsive design  Consistent experience across web and mobile channels
This layer consolidates today's fragmented portals into a single Veteran workspace, improving usability and reducing abandonment.

All Veteran interactions--questions, applications, claims, appointments, and support requests--are managed as structured workflows with full lifecycle tracking.
Agentforce and the Veteran Digital Buddy
Agentforce enables FedRAMP High-authorized agentic AI that acts as a digital concierge for Veterans.
The Veteran Digital Buddy can:
 Answer benefit and service questions using authoritative VA data  Guide Veterans through complex applications step by step  Check claim, payment, or appointment status in real time  Initiate service requests and updates through backend systems  Escalate to human VA representatives with full context preserved
This capability extends VA's service availability to 24x7 while reducing call center demand and Veteran wait times.AI responses are grounded through the Einstein Trust Layer, ensuring data is VA-approved and not used to train external models.

Marketing Cloud as a Proactive Engagement Layer
Marketing Cloud provides the timing, orchestration, and personalization that transforms VA.gov from a passive portal into an ongoing relationship.
Key functions include:
 Event-driven notifications (e.g., claim status changes, appointment reminders)  Omni-channel outreach based on Veteran preferences  Hyper-personalized messaging tied to eligibility and life events

Salesforce Data 360 and Tableau provide a unified Veteran profile by logically connecting data across VA systems while preserving systems of record.
Capabilities include:
 Identity resolution across benefits, healthcare, and service systems  Real-time personalization and segmentation  Operational dashboards for frontline teams  Executive and leadership analytics
This layer enables VA to shift from reactive service delivery to proactive, data-informed engagement.

Enterprise Integration (MuleSoft)
MuleSoft Anypoint Platform serves as the API-led integration and orchestration layer, abstracting the complexity of VA's backend environment.
Key benefits:
 Secure, reusable APIs for legacy and modern systems  Real-time data synchronization across platforms  Event-driven integration to support responsiveness  Faster delivery of new digital services
This allows backend modernization to proceed independently without disrupting the Veteran experience.

4.2 Case Studies and Examples from Similar Environments
Salesforce technologies have been successfully deployed across many large-scale public sector and highly regulated environments. They modernize digital engagement, improve service delivery, and increase operational efficiency. These implementations show that Salesforce can serve as a secure, enterprise-grade digital front door which integrates smoothly with complex backend systems.
Within the Department of Veterans Affairs, Salesforce Experience Cloud is already being used at national scale across multiple programs, supporting both internal staff and external partners. These implementations manage sensitive Veteran data and integrate with core VA systems. They provide secure, role-based access--all while meeting federal security and compliance requirements.

RFI response: Replacement of VA.gov | JourneyBlazers

Some of the examples are portals supporting fiduciary accounting submissions, eligibility verification, caregiver records management, visitor engagement reporting, policy libraries, grants administration, and vendor collaboration. Together, these implementations support hundreds of thousands of records and users. They also demonstrate Salesforce's ability to operate reliably within VA's technical and governance environment.

Beyond VA, Salesforce Experience Cloud has been used by other federal agencies to deliver public-facing data portals and mission-critical digital services. For example, a large federal agency responsible for administering loans and grants across dozens of programs implemented a Salesforce-based digital portal and analytics platform to consolidate data from more than 70 programs into a single, user-friendly interface. This solution significantly reduced response times to data requests, improved transparency, and gave both the internal leadership and the public access to timely insights through interactive dashboards. The platform grew to support hundreds of dashboards and delivered information quickly without the need of additional standalone systems.

Across these environments, a few common success factors stand out. e.g. include the use of API-led integration to connect legacy systems, configuration-first platform design to reduce custom development, and unified data models to improve visibility and decision-making. These case examples show how Salesforce can support millions of users, handle sensitive data, and evolve incrementally. This makes it well suited to serve as the foundation for a modernized VA.gov experience.

4.3 User journey workflows for identity proofing, sign-in, recovery, and navigation.
Salesforce supports end-to-end user journeys for identity proofing, sign-in, recovery, and navigation.
Identity Proofing and Registration
 Customizable, headless registration flows  One-time password (OTP) verification via email or SMS  Secure onboarding integrated with VA identity providers
Sign-In and Authentication
 Single sign-on with MFA  Federated authentication across VA services  Persistent secure sessions
Account Recovery

4.4 Known Limitations, Risks, and Tradeoffs
Key risks include migration complexity, organizational change, and adoption at national scale.
These risks are mitigated through:
 Phased migration and parallel operations  API-led integration instead of system replacement  Configuration-first design over custom development  Early Veteran usability testing and feedback loops  Reuse of VA's existing Salesforce ELA and GovCloud Plus environment
Together, these strategies avoid high-risk "rip and replace" efforts and they enable the continuous modernization as well.
4.5 Lessons Learned from Similar Deployments
Experience from public sector implementations point to various critical lessons:
 Incremental modernization reduces risk and improves adoption  AI delivers more value only when it is grounded in authoritative data and workflows  Platform consolidation matters. It drives long-term cost avoidance  Unified data models reduce rework and "swivel chair" operations  Reusable APIs accelerate innovation. They also help to reduce sustainment costs
By consolidating portal, CRM, AI, marketing, analytics, and integration capabilities on Salesforce Government Cloud Plus, VA can reduce redundancy, lower operations and maintenance costs, and establish a durable foundation for future modernization.
