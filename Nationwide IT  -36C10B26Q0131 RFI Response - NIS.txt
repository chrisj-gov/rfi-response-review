RESPONSE TO THE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS
NIS delivers digital modernization and web platform services for federal agencies, with experience supporting some of the government's largest, highest-visibility public websites, including IRS.gov and USGS.gov. NIS is both a Drupal Certified Partner and an Adobe-Certified Partner, bringing proven expertise across leading federal web and experience platforms. As a vendor-agnostic integrator, NIS works with customers to plan and implement the best-fit solution based on mission requirements, compliance needs, user experience goals, and available funding, tailoring the right tools and operating model rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all product.
NIS understands the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s objective is to assess industry capabilities and best practices to replace VA.gov with a modern, secure, and Veteran-centric digital front door that supports identitylinked journeys and consistent post-auth continuity across benefit portfolios. We recognize that success depends on more than technology selection and requires coordinated modernization across experience design, platform architecture, content strategy and governance, analytics, and operating models, delivered in a way that maintains continuity of service at a national scale in a highly regulated environment where security, privacy, accessibility, and reliability are non-negotiable.
To support that outcome, NIS recommends a structured, evidence-based approach that preserves optionality early and reduces risk through measurable decision gates. This includes an Analysis of Alternatives, a focused Discovery and Feasibility Study, and a small set of pilots to de-risk foundational capabilities such as identity proofing/signin/recovery, content-at-scale publishing and governance, and representative transactional journeys. The program should then transition to phased execution using parallel run and incremental cutovers, supported by strong testing, observability, and progressive delivery practices so VA can modernize confidently while protecting mission-critical pathways and continuously improving Veteran outcomes.
1. VISION FOR THE REPLACEMENT VA.GOV EXPERIENCE
NIS envisions the replacement VA.gov experience as a premier, Veteran-centric digital front door that enables Veterans, families, caregivers, and other stakeholders to complete high-value tasks through clear, consistent, end-to-end journeys across VA benefit portfolios. The end state is a unified experience where users can discover the right service, understand eligibility and next steps, complete transactions, and track outcomes without disconnected tools, inconsistent patterns, or unnecessary handoffs, making VA.gov feel like one coherent service rather than a collection of separate programs.
At the core of this vision is trust and safety, anchored in next-generation digital identity, authentication, and account recovery. Veterans must be able to confidently sign in, verify identity when required, recover access quickly when issues arise, and maintain continuity across sessions and portfolios. Post-auth experiences should preserve context and reduce friction, enabling identity-linked journeys that support appropriate personalization and guidance while maintaining clear privacy guardrails, transparency, and governance.
The replacement experience must also deliver high performance and reliability at a national scale while embedding accessibility as a first-order requirement. The end state should prioritize fast page loads, resilient delivery, predictable releases, and operational readiness that protects continuity throughout modernization, preserving the benefits of VA.gov's decoupled, static-first posture while modernizing integration seams for safer incremental change. It should provide consistent, Section 508-compliant experiences across portfolios using USWDS-aligned patterns, and enable measurable improvement through strong content governance, coherent information architecture, and shared analytics that track completion, drop-off, error rates, and recovery success.

2. RECOMMENDED METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH FOR THE REPLACEMENT MODEL
As a solution-agnostic partner, Nationwide IT Services recommends a structured, evidence-based approach that enables VA to select the best-fit replacement model for VA.gov based on mission outcomes, risk tolerance, compliance requirements, integration realities, and available funding, without prematurely committing to a single platform or vendor. This approach is designed to protect continuity of service for millions of users while steadily improving Veteran journeys through incremental, measurable releases.
We recommend starting with an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) to define and compare viable replacement models, such as modernize-in-place, enterprise Digital Experience Platform (DXP) consolidation, and composable/hybrid architectures, against a consistent set of decision criteria. The AOA should be grounded in VA's priorities: Veteran experience outcomes, continuity risk, security/privacy/accessibility impacts (including Section 508), integration feasibility across legacy and emerging systems, operational sustainability (observability and release cadence), and total cost of ownership. The outcome of the AOA is a clear recommendation, with an initial roadmap and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost/schedule ranges that reflect funding constraints and sequencing options. Following the AOA, we recommend a focused Discovery and Feasibility Study to establish the "as-is" baseline and convert strategy into an executable migration plan. This study should map the current content ecosystem and publishing workflows, the build and release pipeline, critical integrations and dependencies, and, most importantly, the end-to-end Veteran user experience journeys that must remain stable and improve throughout the transition. Because Veterans experience VA.gov as connected tasks rather than isolated features, high-quality UX design is critical to the study: it identifies friction points and failure modes, clarifies decision steps and handoffs between systems, and ensures consistent, accessible patterns that build trust and reduce abandonment. In parallel, the VA and Nationwide IT Services would define practical governance and operating model elements, including decision rights, intake/prioritization, standards, and release gates, and establish an analytics and measurement plan so progress can be objectively tracked and iteratively improved. The study outputs a prioritized backlog, a wave-based migration plan aligned to journey priorities, and cutover/rollback playbooks suitable for incremental production adoption. Next, we recommend running a small set of pilots (typically two to four) to validate the AOA recommendation and de-risk the biggest decisions before scaling. These pilots should be chosen to represent different levels of complexity and to establish reusable patterns. For example, a foundational pilot should prove identity proofing, such as sign-in and authentication, because these capabilities anchor trust and determine whether Veterans can move seamlessly across portfolios based on their unique identities. A second pilot can validate content-at-scale publishing and governance for high-traffic sections, including search/routing and accessibility quality controls. A third pilot should prove an end-to-end transactional journey (e.g., a form-based workflow) including save-in-progress, document/evidence handling, status tracking, and downstream integration behavior. Each pilot should be measured using agreed success criteria and operational readiness thresholds so VA can make informed decisions about scaling. With pilots complete, we recommend transitioning into phased execution using an incremental migration strategy. This approach maintains service continuity by modernizing by journey, portfolio, or capability, while legacy components continue to operate in parallel until replacement components prove stable. The program should establish "Wave 0" foundations (DevSecOps, observability, design system alignment, automated accessibility checks, analytics

RFI Response to Replacement Model for VA.gov Response Date: February 5, 2026
instrumentation) and then proceed through migration waves that prioritize the highest-impact Veteran journeys and highest-traffic content first. Throughout execution, releases should be controlled through feature flags, canary/bluegreen deployments, and well-practiced rollback procedures, with contract-first integration practices that reduce coupling and support safe iteration.
Finally, we recommend explicit decision gates at each stage to preserve vendor neutrality and reduce risk: an AOA gate to select the direction to pilot, a pilot gate to confirm platform decisions and migration patterns using measured results, and wave gates to scale only when continuity, security/privacy, accessibility, and performance criteria are consistently met. This approach keeps VA's options open early, produces near-term value through pilots, and enables confident, continuous modernization toward a future-state VA.gov that is modern, secure, Veteran-centric, and resilient.
3. TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES
VA's RFI requests descriptions of technologies and approaches that can fundamentally improve the digital experience across all benefit portfolios while maintaining continuity of service, integrating with diverse systems, and operating within a regulated federal environment. In that context, NIS recommends an approach that builds on VA.gov's strengths, including decoupled content operations and static-first delivery, while modernizing integration seams and delivery mechanics to enable high-confidence, incremental cutovers. A practical path is to preserve static-first delivery where it improves performance and resilience, while strengthening build and publish reliability and speed, improving content modeling and governance to support reuse and consistency across portfolios, and adopting contract-first integration patterns that reduce coupling and enable phased migration of authenticated and transactional experiences.
3.1 Replacement Model Alternatives (Drupal + FedRAMP CMS Platform vs. Adobe AEM)
NIS works collaboratively with clients to select and implement the solution set that best meets mission outcomes, security and compliance requirements, delivery velocity, and total cost of ownership. In evaluating CMS platform directions, it is relevant that VA.gov is currently implemented as a decoupled, staticfirst platform with a static front end and a separate API/service tier. From a publishing perspective, VA.gov uses a decoupled Drupal CMS (Drupal 10.1) for authoring and governance, and a build-time pipeline that queries Drupal via GraphQL and generates static pages (e.g., via Metalsmith) for delivery from S3. In replacement terms, the architecture separates into two modernization tracks: content publishing at scale and authenticated and transactional experiences powered by the API layer, which underscores the need to preserve continuity across both while incrementally modernizing the integration boundaries. Additionally, VA already has organizational precedent for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) usage, including a published Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for "AEM for Managed Services (AEMMS) - GovCloud - E" (version date October 1, 2024; PIA submitted for review April 17, 2025). The PIA describes data being hosted within the Adobe environment on AWS GovCloud and authorized for use at FedRAMP Moderate, establishing a privacy and governance precedent that may reduce adoption friction if AEM is considered for expanded use.

RFI Response to Replacement Model for VA.gov Response Date: February 5, 2026

Option 1: Modernize in place with Drupal on a FedRAMP-authorized Drupal platform (e.g., Acquia). This option retains Drupal as the CMS and preserves the existing decoupled model (CMS  build  static delivery), which aligns directly to VA.gov's current-state implementation. In practice, this is often the lowest continuity risk path because content governance and authoring patterns remain familiar, while hosting, operations, and compliance controls can be strengthened through a FedRAMP-authorized approach.

Option 2: Shift to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) using a FedRAMP-authorized offering with a headless or hybrid implementation. This option uses AEM as the enterprise content platform while preserving a decoupled delivery posture that can still support static-first delivery and modern experience composition. The advantage is leveraging AEM's enterprise content operations capabilities and VA's existing AEMMS GovCloud precedent, including the FedRAMP Moderate context. The primary tradeoff is a larger change footprint across content models, workflows, migration tooling, and training, which should be managed through phased migration and clear platform boundaries to avoid introducing a monolithic bottleneck.

Option 3: Composable dual-CMS that retains Drupal for structured service content and introduces AEM selectively for enterprise content operations. This hybrid approach reduces program risk by avoiding an all-at-once CMS swap while enabling VA to scale targeted enterprise capabilities. The tradeoff is increased governance complexity, requiring clear canonical source-of-truth rules, taxonomy alignment, and an intentional composition strategy so navigation, analytics, and content consistency remain coherent across portfolios.

Recommended evaluation path: Where VA prioritizes service continuity and controlled risk, begin with Option 1 while modernizing build and publish seams and service integration patterns incrementally, consistent with the current-state pipeline. Where VA prioritizes enterprise DXP consolidation, pursue Option 2 through a phased migration approach that leverages the existing AEMMS GovCloud privacy and governance precedent.

4. Experience Design, Content Strategy, and Governance
The following approach outlines how NIS would align experience design, content strategy, and cross-portfolio governance to deliver consistent, Veteran-centric journeys while maintaining continuity and compliance at scale.

Experience Design: NIS uses a journey-first approach that maps priority end-to-end Veteran tasks (pre-auth through post-auth), standardizes patterns through USWDS-aligned components, and measures journey performance using shared Customer Experience metrics (completion, drop-off, error rates, recovery success) to drive iteration and wave sequencing.

Content Strategy: NIS establishes an enterprise content model and taxonomy to enable reuse and consistent navigation, then implements governed lifecycle workflows for authoring, review/approval, versioning, and translation, with plain-language and accessibility standards baked in.

Governance: NIS defines clear decision rights across portfolios, publishes a small set of enforceable standards (experience, content, accessibility, analytics), provides a documented exception process, and uses release gates tied to accessibility, performance, security/privacy, and regression readiness before scaling changes.

Provider-specific recovery safeguards include Login.gov personal key and ID.me recovery code/MFA recovery mechanisms. Offer recovery methods that don't require a smartphone where possible (e.g., security key, authenticator apps on alternative devices, backup codes); provide plain-language, step-by-step recovery guidance; ensure recovery screens and errors are WCAG-aligned; provide call-center support scripts and assisted pathways for users without mobile access. VA explicitly addresses options for users without a mobile phone. Recovery success rate (overall + by provider); time-to-recover (median/p95); recovery path distribution (password reset vs MFA recovery); drop-off points (email verification, MFA challenge, recovery code/personal key step); retry and lockout rates; rate-limiting triggers; % of users who end up creating a new provider account; post-recovery "return-to-task" completion rate; support contact rate per 1,000 recovery attempts.

5.4 Navigation User Journey
The objective of this user journey is to allow veterans to securely navigate to find the right content or tools on VA.gov (Appendix A - Figure 4).

Navigation Veteran (primary); Family member / Dependent; Caregiver; VSO (helping the user find the right VA.gov pathway); VA staff (supporting users and troubleshooting navigation issues) Users can find the right content or tool quickly, maintain context and orientation as they move across VA.gov, and complete tasks with predictable, consistent navigation that works across devices. VA's Header provides required global navigation across VA.gov. VA.gov homepage; topic hub pages; deep links from search engines or bookmarks; deep links from VA email/SMS/letters; in-app links from authenticated tools to supporting content and back; internal site search from the header. Low for public content browsing; Medium when entering authenticated areas (session-aware navigation); Step-up as needed when navigation leads into higher-risk actions (e.g., sensitive record views or submissions). (Navigation should route users to sign-in gates when required without exposing protected data.)

1) User lands on a VA.gov page (often from a deep link). 2) User orients using global header navigation to browse major sections. 3) User uses header search (with type-ahead suggestions when enabled) to find relevant content/tools. 4) User selects a hub/landing page and follows curated links to the right benefit/service pathway. 5) Within a product area, user uses side navigation (and/or in-app nav) to move between sections without losing place; SPA routing can be handled via router integration events. 6) User refines results where appropriate using search results patterns/filters (e.g., search results templates or faceted filtering). 7) User reaches target destination (content page or tool entry point) and either continues unauthenticated or signs in if required. 8) User confirms completion and can navigate back via consistent headers/footers and contextual navigation.
Broken/changed URLs (404s), outdated bookmarks; inconsistent labels between content and tools; deep link into an authenticated page without a session (needs clear sign-in gate + return-to-task); "lost in navigation" on mobile vs desktop; long lists requiring progressive disclosure; accessibility needs (keyboard-only, screen readers); limited connectivity; language assistance needs; search returning too-broad/irrelevant results; cross-application handoffs that drop context or parameters. (VA patterns include guidance for navigating long lists.)
Front-end routing (SPA + server-rendered pages); global header/footer components; CMS/content publishing system(s) (e.g., Drupal-managed pages); search service + type-ahead; analytics/telemetry; feature flags/redirect service; authentication gateway for protected tools (when navigation crosses into authenticated experiences). (VA notes some unauthenticated entry pages are managed in Drupal by a central team, which commonly includes tool entry points.) Prevent open redirects and unsafe return URLs; avoid leaking sensitive info in query strings/URLs; enforce auth checks before rendering protected data; ensure logout clears authenticated nav state; protect against link injection in CMS content; consistent domain signaling and UI to reduce phishing risk; log navigation-to-auth handoffs for troubleshooting (without storing PII in logs). WCAG-aligned global navigation with visible focus, keyboard support, and screen reader labeling; skip-to-content and predictable structure; SPA route changes should manage focus and announce navigation changes appropriately (side navigation supports router integration and routechange handling).
Navigation success rate (user reaches intended destination); time-to-destination; click paths (header nav vs search vs hub links); search usage and refinement rates; top "no results" queries; bounce/backtrack rates; dead-end and 404 rates; mobile vs desktop differences; authenticated handoff success ("return-to-task" after sign-in); accessibility cohort outcomes.

6. Known Limitations, Risks, and Tradeoffs
Replacing VA.gov is a high-impact effort where the primary challenge is maintaining continuity of service for millions of users while modernizing identity-linked journeys, content publishing, and integrations in a regulated, high-visibility environment. The phased approach described earlier reduces risk through AOA, Discovery, pilots, and wave-based migration with decision gates, but the following limitations, risks, and tradeoffs remain and should be managed explicitly.

6.1 Limitations of the Recommended Approach
Incremental modernization takes longer to fully realize the end-state: A phased strategy reduces risk, but it typically extends the timeline to achieve full replacement compared to a single cutover.

Parallel run increases operational overhead: Running legacy and replacement components side-by-side (parallel run/strangler pattern) requires additional coordination, monitoring, and release management until retirement is complete.

Early vendor neutrality delays firm platform standardization: Reserving optionality through an AOA and measured pilot validation avoids premature lock-in, but it limits early standardization until decision gates are reached.

Static-first delivery can constrain rapid change if build/publish seams are not improved: Preserving static-first delivery where it benefits performance and resilience is valuable but build-time pipelines can become a constraint unless reliability and speed improvements are made early.

Hybrid/Dual-CMS options add governance complexity: If VA pursues a composable dual-CMS approach, it requires mature governance (source-of-truth rules, taxonomy alignment, composition strategy) to prevent fragmentation across portfolios.

Mitigation Incremental migration with cutover/rollback playbooks, explicit readiness gates, and measured scaling. Treat identity/sign-in/recovery as foundational pilots; track drop-off, errors, and recovery success; iterate before broad rollout. Use contract-first integration patterns to reduce coupling, sequence migration waves based on dependency readiness, and validate end-to-end behavior during pilots and wave releases before scaling.
Migrate in controlled waves with clear source-oftruth rules, stronger content modeling, and governance standards. Preserving static-first where beneficial, while modernizing build/publish seams early as part of foundational work.

6.3 Major Tradeoffs
Speed vs Governance Rigor: Faster releases increase regression risk; stronger release gates reduce risk but can slow throughput. The recommended approach balances this with incremental releases and scaling only when readiness criteria are met.

Consolidation vs Flexibility: Enterprise DXP consolidation can improve consistency but increases change footprint and adoption effort; modernize-in-place or composable approaches reduce disruption but require stronger governance to keep experiences coherent.

Standardization vs Portfolio Autonomy: Shared patterns improve consistency and accessibility but constrain portfolio variation; governance and design-system alignment should be treated as trust and continuity requirements.

Static-First Resilience vs Dynamic Transactional Needs: Static-first improves performance and resilience, while authenticated and transactional journeys increase complexity; the approach preserves static-first benefits while modernizing integration boundaries for safe incremental evolution.

7. Lessons Learned from Past Deployments
The table below summarizes experience-based lessons learned from past high-scale federal deployments that would directly relate to a VA.gov replacement effort.

Lesson Learned Design for continuity from day one
De-risk identity and recovery early to protect trust Modernize platforms with disciplined dependency governance Use measurable outcomes to drive decisions

Description In 247365, high-traffic environments, even small changes can create an outsized impact during peak periods. Identity proofing, sign-in, and account recovery determine whether users can complete end-to-end tasks. Large Drupal upgrade roadmaps can stall without clear ownership of modules and remediation paths. Without consistent measurement, teams optimize for output instead of user success.

Treat the build/publish pipeline as missioncritical

In decoupled, static first models, publishing reliability and build-time performance often become the delivery bottleneck.

What We Would Do Differently Define "critical pathways" up front and require cutover and rollback playbooks for every release.
Make identity and recovery a first pilot with clear success metrics (drop-off, error rates, recovery success) before scaling Rationalize dependencies early (keep/replace/retire), automate compatibility checks, and sequence upgrades to avoid rework. Define a small set of journey KPIs early (completion, drop-off, errors, recovery success, performance) and use them at pilot and wave gates. Invest earlier in build/publish reliability, caching, and content validation controls.

Lesson Learned Reduce integration failures with contractfirst patterns
Embed accessibility in standards and release gates

Description Complex legacy and emerging ecosystems create brittle point-to-point dependencies that break end-to-end journeys.
Accessibility degrades when multiple teams ship without consistent patterns and checks.

What We Would Do Differently Formalize integration contracts and versioning, and validate downstream behaviors through pilots and phased waves before scaling broader adoption. Enforce USWDS-aligned, Section 508-compliant patterns, automate checks in the pipeline, and block releases when thresholds fail.

Phased migration lowers risk but increases coordination needs Test journeys, not just components

Parallel run and incremental cutovers require strong governance to avoid fragmentation. Regression testing often verifies system components after changes, but it should also cover critical user journeys end-to-end to ensure workflows still function as expected.

Establish clear decision rights, shared standards, and a wave-based roadmap early.
Prioritize end-to-end regression testing for critical pathways, including end-to-end user journey testing.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELEVANT TO VA OBJECTIVES

To support VA's planning, NIS recommends running a small set of targeted pilots, using an agile/sprint based delivery, that validate the most critical replacement decisions before scaling: first, an identity foundation pilot covering signin, identity proofing, account recovery, and post-auth continuity; second, a high-traffic content publishing pilot to validate governance, authoring workflows, and build/publish reliability at scale; and third, a representative transactional journey pilot to prove end-to-end task completion and integration behavior. Each pilot should be evaluated using consistent, outcome-based measures such as journey completion and drop-off, time-to-complete, return-to-task success, performance, availability, Section 508 accessibility results, and security/privacy readiness, and used as decision inputs for gating and phased rollout.
