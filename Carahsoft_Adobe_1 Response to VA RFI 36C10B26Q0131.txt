SOLUTION OVERVIEW
A Modern, Governed Digital Experience for Veterans
The Department of Veterans Affairs effort to modernize VA.gov represents far more than a website replacement. It is an opportunity to fundamentally rethink how digital services support Veterans across moments that are often complex, high-stakes, and deeply personal. VA serves an extraordinarily diverse population, ranging from Veterans who expect intuitive, mobile-first experiences to those with limited digital confidence, accessibility needs, or reliance on caregivers and VA staff. A modern VA.gov must work for all of them, without creating friction or exclusion for those who depend on VA services the most.
Adobe's mission is to change the world through digital experiences. In the context of VA.gov, that mission translates into a responsibility to design experiences that are clear, inclusive, trustworthy, and resilient at national scale. Adobe proposes a VA.gov foundation built on AEM Edge Delivery Services for content management and experience delivery, integrated with Adobe Experience Platform for data, insights, and personalization. This platform-based

approach is grounded in experience design, reinforced by governance, and built to evolve responsibly over time. It delivers immediate gains in performance, accessibility, and content operations, while establishing a durable foundation that can adapt as VA policies, priorities, and technologies change.

Equally important is the operational impact on the VA workforce. Digital services cannot scale when routine updates require specialized technical expertise or lengthy handoffs. By enabling content to be authored in familiar tools such as Microsoft Word and governed through structured templates and workflows, Adobe empowers subject matter experts to keep information accurate and accessible, while enforcing governance, accessibility, and compliance as part of the content lifecycle.

Speed without Compromise.
Adobe Experience Manager separates content from complexity to deliver pages at the edge--fast, resilient, and easy to manage--so the VA can move faster and scale trusted Veteran experiences without traditional CMS overhead.

This foundation enables experiences designed around Veteran intent rather than site structure. Veterans who prefer fast self-service can move efficiently, while those who benefit from guidance, simplified language, or assisted support are not forced into separate or degraded experiences. Navigation and experience flow are designed to introduce authentication when it adds value, preserving clarity and continuity across both authenticated and unauthenticated interactions.

Adobe's platform uniquely combines experience delivery with a unified experience data foundation through the Adobe Experience Platform. This allows VA to understand where Veterans encounter friction, improve journeys over time, and responsibly introduce advanced analytics and AI-driven capabilities under VA governance. These capabilities are not speculative add-ons, but practical tools to improve clarity, reduce operational burden, and better serve Veterans at scale.

A Platform Foundation for Experience-Led Modernization
Adobe's approach begins with an experience-led platform foundation designed to support modernization at scale. Built on AEM Sites with Edge Delivery Services and connected through the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), this foundation unifies experience delivery, content operations, and experience data within a single, governed architecture. Together, these capabilities enable a decoupled, edge-first model that prioritizes performance, accessibility, and adaptability, while giving VA the flexibility to evolve experiences, identity integrations, and intelligence independently over time.

Edge-First Experience Delivery

Solicitation Number 36C10B26Q0131
Adobe Edge Delivery Services enables VA.gov to deliver experiences globally with high performance, resilience, and scalability. By rendering and serving content at the network edge, VA can deliver fast, reliable experiences regardless of traffic volume or user location, including rural or bandwidth-constrained environments.
More importantly, Edge Delivery Services shifts VA.gov away from page-centric CMS delivery toward experiencedriven architecture. Experience updates can be deployed independently of backend systems, identity services, and data sources, allowing VA to evolve journeys, navigation, and content models without introducing infrastructure complexity or coordinated cutovers.
This approach reflects Adobe's broader Experience Cloud philosophy: the experience layer should be fast, flexible, and designed around Veteran needs, while backend systems can evolve on their own timelines and modernization paths.
This model supports:  Consistently fast page loads and improved end-user reliability  Reduced infrastructure complexity and lower operational and maintenance overhead  Increased resilience and scalability during traffic spikes, surges, and peak demand periods  True semantic content-first authoring for maximum flexibility
Simplified, Governed Content Authoring
Adobe's approach is built around content velocity with governance by design. VA subject matter experts can author content in familiar tools such as Microsoft Word, using structured templates and workflows. This allows teams across healthcare, benefits, and services to keep information accurate and current without specialized CMS expertise. Don't just take our word for it - the VA can explore AEM Edge Delivery Services on their own by navigating to https://www.aem.live/ and start building your own site: https://www.aem.live/developer/tutorial
Unlike traditional CMS platforms that push governance to downstream review cycles or manual checks, Adobe embeds accessibility standards, content structure, and approval workflows directly into the authoring lifecycle. Compliance and consistency are enforced before content is published, which:
 Reduces rework and operational risk  Improves accessibility and content quality  Accelerates the time required to update and publish changes
This model reflects Adobe's experience supporting large, distributed content organizations, where accuracy, accessibility, and accountability are as critical as speed and scale.
A Durable Platform for Experience, Data, and Intelligence
While this foundation delivers immediate performance and operational benefits, it is intentionally designed to support deeper experience capabilities over time. Adobe's platform uniquely combines experience delivery with a unified experience data foundation, enabling VA to move beyond static content toward insight-driven, adaptive journeys when ready.
Through the Adobe Experience Platform, VA can unify experience signals across VA.gov, understand where Veterans encounter friction or abandon journeys, and apply those insights to improve clarity, navigation, and service outcomes. Unlike CRM-centric or CMS-only approaches, this model treats experience data as a shared asset across channels, rather than confining it to individual tools or workflows.
On top of this foundation, VA can introduce advanced analytics and AI-assisted capabilities in a deliberate, governed manner, supporting content quality, journey optimization, and operational insight without replatforming or major architectural rework.

CAPABILITY

Sarah accesses VA.gov from a mobile device, potentially in a rural or bandwidth-constrained environment. The experience is immediately responsive and clear, delivered through Adobe's edge-first architecture to ensure reliable access regardless of location or device. Rather than navigating dense menus, Sarah is presented with clear entry points that help her understand next steps and what information she will need.
After signing in, the experience adapts to Sarah's context as a newly transitioned Veteran. Navigation and content emphasize healthcare enrollment and eligibility, guiding her through the process using plain language and VAapproved information. The experience does not interpret policy or make decisions on her behalf. Instead, it reduces uncertainty by helping her understand where to go and what to expect.
As Sarah completes enrollment, contextual guidance helps clarify unfamiliar terminology, allowing her to complete the process with greater confidence and fewer interruptions. This approach supports Veterans who prefer fast selfservice as well as those who benefit from additional guidance, without forcing separate experiences.
Sarah's journey illustrates how Adobe enables VA to move beyond page-based navigation toward guided, inclusive experiences that reduce cognitive load and improve completion, while remaining fully governed and adaptable over time.
Identity, Navigation, and Experience Flow
VA.gov is not a single experience, but a constellation of public information, authenticated services, assisted workflows, and recovery scenarios. At VA scale, the challenge is not simply verifying identity but designing experiences that remain coherent as identity states change across a Veteran's journey.

Solicitation Number 36C10B26Q0131
Rather than organizing VA.gov around menus, organizational structures, or system boundaries, experiences can be designed around Veteran intent. Veterans should be guided based on what they are trying to accomplish, such as enrolling in healthcare, checking claim status, or understanding eligibility, with identity and authentication introduced at points where they meaningfully support progress, protect sensitive information, or enable completion of services.
This approach reduces friction by allowing Veterans to orient themselves before being required to authenticate, while still ensuring that secure access and personalization are applied when appropriate. Clear entry points aligned to Veteran goals, progressive disclosure of complexity, and consistent experience patterns across authenticated and unauthenticated states help preserve continuity and trust.
AEM serves as the system of record for content, navigation, and experience structure, while identity, authentication, and authorization remain governed by VA-approved providers. By keeping experience delivery decoupled from identity enforcement, VA can evolve identity strategies independently without fragmenting the Veteran experience. Where policy allows, context can be preserved across identity states to reduce repetition and frustration. Where policy requires boundaries, transitions remain explicit and understandable.
This decoupling is reinforced through Adobe Edge Delivery Services, which allows navigation models and experience flows to be refined over time without destabilizing the platform or requiring replatforming. As VA pilots new identity approaches or navigation paradigms, changes can be reflected incrementally in the experience layer rather than treated as disruptive technical events.
VA's population also includes Veterans who rely on caregivers, family members, and VA staff to help navigate services. Adobe's experience architecture supports assisted, delegated, and recovery scenarios by enabling shared visibility, VA-governed permissions, and clear re-entry paths when sessions are interrupted or credentials are lost. These patterns ensure that Veterans are not excluded by assumptions about digital confidence or independence, while remaining aligned with VA governance and security requirements.
As these experiences evolve, VA can use experience signals and tools such as Adobe Sites Optimizer to understand where Veterans encounter friction across identity transitions and refine navigation and guidance accordingly. This allows VA.gov to function as a stable digital front door while continuously improving how Veterans find, understand, and complete services.
AI-Powered Capabilities: Moving from Manual Scale to Intelligent Scale
Modernizing VA.gov cannot rely on manual processes alone. The volume of content, the diversity of Veteran needs, and the pace of policy and service change create a level of operational complexity that outgrows traditional digital models. As a market leader, Adobe believes AI has a meaningful role to play in helping VA modernize responsibly, provided it is applied deliberately, transparently, and under strong governance.
Adobe's AI capabilities are designed to augment human judgment, not replace it. They are focused on areas where scale, consistency, and clarity are difficult to achieve manually, while avoiding domains that require authoritative policy interpretation, eligibility determinations, or benefits decisions. This distinction is foundational to Adobe's approach in regulated federal environments.
AI as an Experience Enabler
For Veterans, AI can play a meaningful role in simplifying how services are discovered and understood without inserting automation into decision-making. AI-assisted experiences can help surface relevant information, clarify next steps, and guide Veterans through complex journeys using VA-approved content and terminology - helping earn the Veteran's trust and confidence.

Solicitation Number 36C10B26Q0131
This is particularly valuable for Veterans who struggle with fragmented navigation, unfamiliar language, or uncertainty about where to begin. By reducing cognitive load and repetition, AI-enabled guidance helps Veterans focus on completing tasks rather than deciphering systems. When ambiguity arises, experiences are designed to defer to authoritative VA content or human support channels rather than attempting to resolve uncertainty autonomously. This allows VA to improve usability and clarity without compromising trust or policy control.
Improving Content Operations at VA Scale
One of the most immediate and high-impact applications of AI is within content operations. At VA's scale, maintaining accurate, accessible, and policy-aligned content across thousands of pages is a continuous challenge.
Adobe applies AI to assist VA teams by identifying outdated, redundant, or conflicting content; flagging accessibility and structural issues early in the authoring process; supporting metadata and content organization; and highlighting content that may require review following policy or program changes. These capabilities reduce manual effort while improving consistency and quality.
Importantly, AI does not publish or approve content. Human reviewers retain full authority, with AI serving as an intelligent assist embedded directly into the content lifecycle. This model strengthens governance rather than bypassing it.
Accelerating Modernization and Migration Efforts
Modernizing VA.gov requires more than improving forward-facing experiences. It also requires addressing legacy content, structures, and delivery patterns that slow progress and increase operational risk at scale. Adobe brings AIpowered capabilities into AEM and Edge Delivery Services to support modernization activities that would otherwise require significant manual coordination across teams.
Adobe's Experience Production capabilities reduce the time and effort required to prepare content for modern delivery. Rather than relying on large, manual content rewrites, VA can use AI-assisted production workflows to refactor existing content into governed, performance-optimized experiences that align with VA standards. This approach preserves accessibility requirements, SEO signals, and information hierarchy as content is modernized, rather than attempting to retrofit these concerns after migration.
Enabling Insight-Driven Improvement
Adobe's platform also enables VA to better understand how Veterans actually experience VA.gov. By analyzing patterns across journeys, content engagement, and abandonment points, VA can identify where Veterans struggle or disengage and focus improvement efforts accordingly.
These insights allow VA to prioritize improvements based on real usage rather than assumptions, identify opportunities to simplify journeys, and measure the impact of changes over time.
Governance, Transparency, and Control by Design
Adobe's AI capabilities are built to operate within federal governance frameworks. This includes clear configuration controls, auditability of outputs, and strict use of VA-approved data and content sources. AI models are applied where they create operational advantage while remaining transparent, explainable, and subject to human oversight.
Adobe does not position AI as a mandatory dependency for VA.gov modernization. Instead, AI is an integrated capability that allows VA to modernize faster and more effectively than manual approaches alone, when and where VA determines it is appropriate.

Trade-offs, Known Limitations, and Design Considerations
Modernizing VA.gov is as much a design challenge as it is a technical one. Recent federal priorities, including the America by Design initiative and the establishment of a Chief Design Officer and National Design Studio, reinforce that public-facing digital services must be intuitive, inclusive, accessible, and worthy of public trust. At national scale, achieving that standard requires deliberate design and architectural choices.

Adobe's approach reflects lessons learned from delivering large, mission-critical platforms in public sector and healthcare environments where experience quality, governance, and operational reality must coexist.

Simplified Authoring Balanced with Design Discipline
Lowering the barrier to content creation is essential for keeping information accurate and timely, but simplicity without structure creates long-term risk. Adobe's document-based authoring approach enables subject matter experts to participate directly in content updates using familiar tools, while enforcing structure, accessibility, and governance through the platform.

This model requires upfront discipline around templates, design standards, and content patterns. That discipline is intentional. It ensures that content remains usable, accessible, and consistent at scale, aligning with federal humancentered design expectations. Platforms that prioritize unrestricted flexibility often shift complexity downstream into review cycles, accessibility remediation, and inconsistent user experiences.

Identity-Aware Design Introduces Experience Complexity

Identity is central to VA.gov, but tightly coupling identity systems to content and

navigation can limit flexibility and introduce risk as policies and technologies evolve. Adobe intentionally separates experience management from identity enforcement, allowing identity to inform the experience without constraining it.

more gracefully. While Adobe provides the architectural foundation for these patterns, VA retains authority over identity policy, permissions, and acceptable

behaviors. Success depends on coordinated design, policy, and governance

decisions rather than technology alone.

AI Enables Scale, Not Autonomy
AI has the potential to materially improve experience quality and operational efficiency, but only when applied to the right problems. Adobe applies AI where scale and consistency are difficult to achieve manually, such as content analysis, experience measurement, and modernization support.

AI-assisted capabilities require active governance, configuration, and ongoing oversight. They are not substitutes for human judgment, policy ownership, or design intent. This approach reflects lessons learned in regulated environments, where attempts to use AI as an autonomous decision-maker often undermine trust. Adobe's design choice preserves accountability while enabling modernization efforts that manual processes alone cannot sustain.

Legacy Systems Remain Part of the Operating Model
Decoupling experience delivery from backend systems allows VA to improve VA.gov without forcing premature replacement of legacy infrastructure. While this means backend complexity persists for a time, it avoids the higher risk associated with tightly coupled, end-to-end transformations.

Solicitation Number 36C10B26Q0131
Adobe's platform is designed to absorb this complexity while enabling forward progress. Over time, as systems are retired or consolidated according to VA priorities, additional efficiencies can be realized without requiring repeated replatforming of the experience layer.
Relevant Experience and Lessons Learned
Adobe's approach to VA.gov modernization is grounded in sustained experience supporting large, mission-critical digital platforms in public sector and healthcare environments. These programs operate under conditions that closely mirror VA's reality, including national scale, diverse populations, strict accessibility and security requirements, and continuous public scrutiny.
The case studies that follow reflect real deployments supported by Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform capabilities. They are presented to illustrate common patterns, architectural decisions, and lessons learned that are directly applicable to VA.gov modernization.
Canada.ca: 100% Uptime Since 2015 Canada.ca is a "digital front door" to Government resources and information for the country's 37+ million residents, serving as an online portal for hundreds of departments and agencies. It accounts for more than 70% of the government's online traffic. With two official languages, English and French, content must be provided both. In 2015, Canada standardized on Adobe for its web platform.
Working closely with Adobe to modernize its digital presence, Canada has achieved remarkable scalability and uptime. The deployment has seamlessly scaled to support 185 million visitors per month while experiencing no downtime or security breaches since 2015. With over 100+ sites completed for Canada.ca, powered by Adobe, the partnership continues.
"Adobe Experience Cloud gives us the reliability and scale we need to manage billions of visits across over 400,000 pages on Canada.ca. It has also given us agility during times like COVID-19, where the need to keep residents informed has been so critical. And the site has been running at 100% availability, with which we are really pleased." -Director General of Digital Services
Security and Compliance
AEM, deployed through Adobe Managed Services, is designed to operate in regulated federal environments where security, privacy, and availability are mandatory requirements. Adobe Managed Services for AEM is authorized at the FedRAMP Moderate level and aligns with federal security standards, including NIST 800-53.

Conclusion and Path Forward
Adobe's mission is to change the world through digital experiences. The VA.gov is not just a website, it is the primary way Veterans understand, access, and trust the services promised to them. The quality of that experience directly shapes confidence, outcomes, and equity. Adobe believes the next chapter of VA.gov should be defined by experience leadership, not just technical modernization. That means designing for clarity over complexity, guidance over navigation, and inclusion over assumption. It means building a digital front door that works equally well for a Veteran who expects fast, mobile selfservice and for one who requires plain language, accessibility accommodations, or caregiver support. AEM provides VA with a foundation purpose-built for this challenge. It allows the VA to separate experience from backend complexity, empower content owners without sacrificing governance, and evolve identity-aware, datainformed journeys over time. Just as importantly, Adobe brings a design-led perspective aligned with federal priorities around human-centered design and service excellence. Adobe's platform was built for organizations that must balance innovation with trust, creativity with accountability, and flexibility with control. This is why Adobe is trusted by the world's most regulated industries and by public sector organizations operating at national scale. VA's modernization effort presents an opportunity to set a new benchmark for federal digital service delivery. Not by moving faster for its own sake, but by building an experience that is clear, durable, and worthy of the people it serves. Adobe stands ready to partner with VA in shaping that future, bringing not only proven technology, but a philosophy of experience design grounded in empathy, governance, and long-term stewardship. Adobe welcomes continued engagement with VA to explore this vision through focused demonstrations, architectural discussions, or targeted pilots.
