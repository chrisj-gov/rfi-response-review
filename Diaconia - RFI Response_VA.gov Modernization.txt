2 A Future-Ready Digital Front Door for Veterans
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates one of the most consequential digital services in the federal government. VA.gov functions as the primary enterprise digital front door through which Veterans, their families, caregivers, and other stakeholders understand eligibility, access benefits and healthcare, complete high-stakes transactions, and develop trust in VA as an institution. For many Veterans, VA.gov is the first, and sometimes only, point of interaction with the Department. The quality, clarity, and reliability of this experience directly affect outcomes, equity, and confidence in government services.
Diaconia approaches modernizing VA.gov as the start of an experience-led renewal rather than a finite, project-based technical exercise. The scale of VA.gov, the diversity of its users, and the regulatory environment in which it operates demand a strategy that promotes trust, prioritizes durability, improves responsiveness to change, ensures continuity of service for the millions of users, and a clear, responsible path to evolution within the bounds of a highly regulated and visible federal environment. Our response presents a platform-neutral modernization strategy grounded in the use of proven commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) digital experience enterprise (DXP) platforms, implemented through a decoupled, experience-led architecture.
Our approach emphasizes Veteran-focused design, governance by design, and operational sustainability. It aligns directly with the VA RFI's stated objectives, including the desire for a modern, intent-driven, veteran-experience focused enterprise digital front door that easily and sustainably integrates with a diverse VA portfolio of applications and data; reduced burden on VA technical staff through native scalability, adaptability, and resilience; and the creation of a future-ready foundation that is ready to adapt and evolve with VA policies, services, and technologies.
The adoption of a COTS enterprise DXP supports these objectives by shifting VA away from custom implementations that accumulate technical debt over time. Mature COTS enterprise platforms provide predictable roadmaps, embedded security and accessibility controls, and operational models that have been validated at scale. When implemented with a focus on configuration rather than customization, they allow VA to benefit from continuous improvement without incurring the long-term cost and risk associated with one-off or monolithic solutions.
3 Veteran-Centered Experience Strategy
In alignment with OMB CX principles, Diaconia's strategy emphasizes designing services around Veteran needs, events, and intents rather than artificial, internal structures. Our objective is to reduce friction,

simplify interactions, and improve task completion across priority Veteran journeys, consistent with federal expectations for human-centered design, equity, and accessibility.
We will work with VA stakeholders to design a modern VA.gov experience around Veteran intent rather than internal organizational structures or backend system boundaries. Veterans typically arrive with specific goals, such as understanding eligibility, enrolling in healthcare, checking benefits or claim status, or determining next steps during major life transitions. Experiences that require users to translate these goals into knowledge of VA programs, acronyms, or system ownership create unnecessary friction and disproportionately affect those with limited digital confidence.
An intent-driven experience strategy creates a central focus around the Veteran to organize navigation, content, and guidance around what they are trying to accomplish in their interaction. Clear entry points, plain language, and progressive disclosure of complexity help users understand what applies to them and what actions they can take next. Our approach reduces cognitive load and uncertainty, enabling Veterans to move forward with greater confidence. It also supports multiple engagement styles, accommodating both Veterans who prefer fast self-service and those who benefit from additional explanation or reassurance.
Inclusivity and accessibility are foundational to this strategy. VA serves a population that includes individuals with disabilities, aging Veterans, rural residents with limited connectivity, and those who rely on caregivers or VA staff for assistance. Experiences must be accessible by default, mobile-responsive, resilient to bandwidth constraints, and designed to support assisted and delegated use cases. Accessibility and usability considerations are embedded directly into templates, components, and content workflows so that compliance and inclusion are achieved consistently at scale rather than through manual remediation.
4 Experience Velocity and Continuity
Diaconia's approach to the future VA.gov is a single, coherent digital front door that both orchestrates endtoend interactions with VA's backend systems and provides intelligent, AIassisted tier 0 support before a human ever needs to get involved. Rather than forcing Veterans to understand which administration or system owns a particular service, our approach to site architecture allows them to express or infer their intent--such as applying for disability benefits, scheduling or managing health care appointments, checking the status of a claim, or resolving an account access issue--and then guide them through completion using content, forms, realtime system integrations, and AIenabled assistance. A modern COTS DXP is built for this kind of orchestration and can act as an experience layer that consumes APIs and microservices from benefits, healthcare, claims, and identity systems, while AI capabilities provide 24/7 tier 0 support through virtual assistants, smart search, and personalized guidance.
In practice, this means that when a Veteran arrives at VA.gov with a question or problem, they can interact first with AIsupported services that resolve many issues without escalation. An AIenabled virtual assistant, grounded in approved VA content and knowledge, can converse in natural language to answer questions about eligibility, guide the user stepbystep through completing a form, or help them troubleshoot signin problems. If the question relates to a specific claim or appointment, the assistant can, with appropriate authentication and authorization, call backend APIs to retrieve realtime information and present it in plain language. AIenhanced search can interpret user queries that are imprecise or written in everyday language, map them to known intents and topics, and surface the most relevant content or tools, significantly reducing the time a Veteran spends hunting through pages and PDFs.
5 COTS Platform Strategy
VA's operational scale, public visibility, and regulatory obligations strongly favor the adoption of proven commercial enterprise platforms over custom-built or experimental solutions. A mature COTS digital experience enterprise platform provides a foundation that accelerates delivery while reducing long-term

operational risk. These enterprise platforms embed security, accessibility, performance, and availability capabilities that have been validated across large enterprises and public-sector environments.
The value of a COTS enterprise platform is realized when it is configured to support VA's experience and governance requirements rather than extensively customized. Configuration allows VA to adapt experiences, templates, and workflows while preserving the ability to apply vendor updates, security patches, and performance improvements without disruption. This approach shortens time to value and reduces the burden on VA technical staff, enabling them to focus on mission-critical integration, oversight, and innovation.
A suitable enterprise platform supports experience and content management as core capabilities, structured and reusable content models, workflow-driven governance, high-performance delivery at national scale, secure integration with identity and transactional systems, and analytics that provide insight into how Veterans actually experience VA.gov. These capabilities collectively support VA's goal of operating a modern enterprise digital front door that is resilient, adaptable, and continuously improving.
6 Content Operations and Governance
VA.gov content spans healthcare, benefits, services, policy guidance, and supporting information that changes frequently in response to legislation, regulation, and program updates. At VA's scale, the challenge is not simply publishing content, but maintaining accuracy, accessibility, and consistency across thousands of pages while minimizing operational friction. A modern operating model must therefore balance distributed ownership with strong central governance.
Our approach using a COTS-based enterprise DXP enables subject matter experts across VA to author and update content directly, using structured templates and governed workflows. This reduces dependence on specialized technical staff for routine updates and shortens the time required to reflect policy or program changes on VA.gov, allowing Veterans to see, understand, and interact with those changes as soon as they are published. Governance is embedded directly into the content lifecycle through enforced structure, accessibility requirements, approval workflows, and version control. By shifting governance earlier in the process, our approach increased velocity, shortens time-to-market, while also reducing downstream remediation, accessibility retrofits, and inconsistency across experiences.
Central to our content approach is the adoption of a structured content model. Content can now be treated as modular, reusable components rather than static pages, allowing information to be reused consistently across multiple journeys, channels, and future touchpoints. This approach improves accuracy, reduces duplication, and enables faster response during periods of rapid change, such as benefit expansions, emergency events, or healthcare policy updates.
7 Applying AI as an Experience Enabler
Artificial intelligence has the potential to materially improve both experience quality and operational efficiency when applied deliberately and under strong governance. Within the context of VA.gov modernization, AI should be viewed as an enabling capability that augments human judgment rather than replaces it.
As VA moves into the highvalue transaction phase, our approach deeply integrates AI with backend systems and data. For example, the assistant can help users start a disability claim, check the status of existing claims, reschedule appointments, or understand letters they receive, by securely invoking APIs and presenting results in plain language. The tier 0 assistant can triage issues, determine when selfservice can resolve them, and when appropriate, suggest escalation to a human agent via phone, chat, or secure messaging, passing along context so that Veterans do not need to repeat themselves. Over time, as more backend systems expose APIs and as VA gains experience with AI usage patterns, the scope of tier 0

resolution can expand. The use of clear governance roles ensures that sensitive or complex cases are still handled by human experts.
This integrated, AIenhanced, COTSbased modernization of VA.gov is expected to yield substantial improvements in speed, accuracy, and outcomes at tier 0. Veterans can get reliable answers to many questions within seconds, at any time of day, without waiting on hold or navigating complex menus. The system can guide them through forms and workflows in ways that reduce incomplete submissions and errors, leading to faster processing and fewer backandforth interactions. By resolving a large portion of routine inquiries and tasks automatically and accurately, AIsupported tier 0 service allows human staff to focus on more complex, highvalue cases where human judgment and empathy are essential. For VA, this translates into improved service quality, higher digital channel adoption, and more efficient use of resources, all while maintaining a strong security and governance posture.
AI is explicitly not positioned as an autonomous decision-maker. It does not interpret policy, determine eligibility, approve benefits, or publish content without human review. All AI-assisted outputs must be transparent, auditable, and subject to VA oversight. This governance-first approach allows VA to benefit from applied AI while preserving trust, accountability, and policy control in a highly regulated environment.
8 Accelerating Migration and Transition
Our VA.gov modernization approach is deliberate and incremental to minimize risk, preserve continuity of service, and maintain public trust. Rather than attempting a large, disruptive cutover, VA can prioritize high-traffic and high-impact experiences first, progressively refactoring legacy content and structures into governed, modern formats. An incremental approach allows time to develop sufficient solutions addressing legacy integrations around content, data, functions, delivery patterns, etc. We leverage AI-assisted migration insights to support increment planning activities that otherwise consume significant time and capacity resources to address across system owners, business units, and other stakeholders. AI-assists are also used on the product front to refactor content and workflows into optimized experiences that align with Veteran intent as well as VA standards to ensure continuity.
Throughout the transition, accessibility, search visibility, and availability must be preserved. Our approach ensures the DXP experience layers (system of engagement) are designed to absorb backend complexity as underlying components or other systems modernize on independent timelines. Our modular approach ensures that Veterans encounter a coherent and simplified enterprise digital front door while also realizing more rapid and incremental experience improvements. Additionally, our approach eliminates the risk associated with big-bang transitions of large, complex platforms and their dependencies.
9 Operating Model and Long-Term Sustainability
Consistent with OMB guidance on CX governance and accountability, Diaconia's approach to replacing VA.gov with a modern DXP promotes a sustained operating model that integrates experience ownership, performance measurement, and continuous improvement. This includes establishing clear accountability for experience standards, governance mechanisms that span organizational boundaries, and feedback loops that use data and qualitative insight to inform prioritization.
A successful VA.gov modernization effort depends as much on operating model alignment as on technology selection. Experience design, content governance, enterprise platform operations, analytics, and security must operate together smoothly as coordinated disciplines rather than isolated functions. To accomplish this, we establish clear ownership of experience standards, shared services for templates and components, and well-defined governance bodies to maintain consistency and velocity at scale to provide an uninterrupted Veteran experience.
We use metrics tied to Veteran outcomes rather than purely technical measures. Completion rates, error reduction, clarity of guidance, and reduction in support requests provide more meaningful indicators of

success than page views alone. Over time, these metrics provide feedback for our continuous improvement efforts and help VA allocate resources to the areas of greatest impact.
Our approach also decouples experience delivery from backend systems to allow VA to improve VA.gov without forcing premature replacement of legacy infrastructure. While this means backend complexity persists for a time, it avoids the higher risk associated with tightly coupled, end-to-end transformations. A modern DXP provides an intentional layer of abstraction designed to accommodate this complexity while enabling forward progress at speed.
Our strategy is to establish a logically layered, future-proof enterprise platform (and its associated architectural and operating models) capable of continuous evolution. It will seamlessly accommodate new services, policy changes, and technological advances without requiring repeated large-scale rebuilds.
