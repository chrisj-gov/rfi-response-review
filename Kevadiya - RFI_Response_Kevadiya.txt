Replacement Model for VA.GOV

Executive Summary
VA.gov is one of the largest citizen-facing digital platforms in the federal government, serving more than 10 million visitors each month. It represents critical infrastructure for the livelihoods, healthcare, and financial security of Veterans and their families. The Department has invested substantially in digital modernization, consolidating hundreds of fragmented sites into a unified digital front door. Despite this effort, a fundamental challenge persists: Veterans continue to struggle to complete tasks and locate relevant information.
The root cause is structural. VA.gov is organized around what VA offers: Benefits, Healthcare, Disability, Education, rather than around what Veterans need to accomplish. This mismatch manifests in information overload across thousands of pages, fragmented journeys across separate systems for claims, appointments, prescriptions, and messaging, and eligibility confusion driven by complex rules that vary by service history, disability rating, and enrollment status.
The opportunity is significant. VA.gov possesses comprehensive content, robust backend systems, and restored public trust. What remains absent is a task-completion layer that interprets intent, displays only what is relevant, collects only what is missing, unifies fragmented systems, preserves context across authentication events, and explains with trust through grounded citations.
We propose an AI Assistant with Dynamic UI, a conversational platform that guides Veterans through tasks while rendering only the information and actions relevant to their current step.

Replacement Model: Cross-Discipline Modernization System

The proposed replacement model operates across six integrated disciplines, each addressing a distinct dimension of the VA.gov challenge.

Three Top Tasks: Dynamic UI in Action
The following screens demonstrate how the AI Assistant with Dynamic UI transforms the three highest-frequency Veteran tasks.
Task 1: Check Claim Status  Understand Meaning  Take Next Action

This screen shows the Veteran checking claim status and immediately being guided to the next required step. The chat summarizes the claim's current stage ("Evidence Gathering"), while the validated Dynamic UI presents progress, what it means (with source citation), and a single clear action: Upload Medical Records with a due date and "Upload Now" CTA-- reducing overload by turning status into status + meaning + next action.

Task 2: Get Official Document  Verify  Download
This screen shows the Veteran getting an official benefits document without hunting throughmenus. The assistant recognizes the intent ("I need a letter proving my benefits"), and the validated Dynamic UI presents the exact artifact (Benefits Summary Letter) with Preview and Download actions plus a short "what this means" explanation with source--turning the task into find  verify  download in one step.
Task 3: Check Eligibility  Understand Benefits  Apply

This screen shows the Veteran completing the eligibility check  understand benefits  take next action flow for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The assistant answers "Am I eligible?" and the validated Dynamic UI summarizes eligibility (service criteria met), quantifies benefits (months remaining, benefit level, housing and book stipend estimates), explains "what this means" with a source link, and routes directly to completion with clear CTAs: Apply for GI Bill (primary) or Compare Schools (secondary).

Identity Workflows: Proofing, Sign-In, Recovery, Navigation

Our approach treats all four journeys as variations of a single architectural pattern: capture intent first, authenticate only when necessary, and restore context completely.

Intent-First Authentication Architecture

1. Capture Intent Before Authentication

The AI Assistant engages the Veteran immediately upon arrival--before any login prompt. Through natural conversation, the system identifies what the Veteran wants to accomplish and determines the minimum authentication level required.

For many tasks, no authentication is needed at all. Eligibility questions, benefit explanations, and facility lookups can be answered immediately. When authentication is required, the Veteran understands why: "To check your specific claim status, I'll need to verify your identity. This should take about 30 seconds."

2. Persist Context Across the Boundary

When authentication is required, the system generates a return-to-task token that encodes the Veteran's intent, conversation state, and any information already collected. This token travels with the authentication request via the OAuth/SAML state parameter.

After successful authentication, the system decodes this token and immediately resumes the task. The Veteran never sees a homepage or has to repeat themselves.

3. Treat Failures as Branches, Not Dead Ends

Authentication failures--failed identity proofing, forgotten passwords, lost 2FA devices-- are common. Rather than displaying error pages, the AI Assistant acknowledges the situation and offers constructive alternatives: in-person verification options, alternative credentials, or warm handoff to support staff who already have the Veteran's context.

Application to Each Journey

Journey

Current Pain Point

Identity Proofing

Veterans fail IAL2 verification without understanding why. Document uploads fail silently. No clear alternatives offered.

AI-Assisted Approach
AI explains requirements upfront, guides document capture, interprets failures in plain language, and offers in-person alternatives at nearby VA facilities.

Journey Sign-In Recovery
Navigation

Current Pain Point
Credential consolidation (Jan 2025) confused Veterans. "Which one do I use?" Multiple redirects lose context.
Lost 2FA device or forgotten password requires call center. Long wait times. Veteran must re-explain situation multiple times.
Site organized by VA structure, not Veteran tasks. 7+ pages to find the right form. Auth interrupts journey and loses context.

AI-Assisted Approach
AI asks "How did you sign in before?" and guides to the right credential. Return-totask token ensures post-login lands on the intended action, not the homepage.
AI triages recovery type, guides selfservice options where possible, and when human help is needed, passes full context to support staff so the Veteran doesn't repeat themselves.
AI interprets intent ("I need to update my address"), determines if auth is needed, prompts only when necessary, and delivers the Veteran directly to a prefilled action--not a page to read.

Technical Implementation

Component

Function

Task Context Store

Secure, short-lived store capturing: detected intent, conversation history, information already collected, required authentication level, and return destination. Encrypted and tied to session; expires after authentication timeout.

Return-to-Task Token

Signed, opaque token passed through OAuth/SAML flow via state parameter. Contains reference to Task Context Store entry. Validated on return to prevent tampering or replay.

Progressive Authentication

AI determines minimum credential level required for each action. Read-only access to appointment history may require only IAL1. Submitting a disability claim requires IAL2. System prompts for stepup authentication only when the specific action demands it.

Tool-call budgets per conversation turn; request coalescing; caching; model tiering (smaller models for simple tasks)
Opt-in introduction; traditional pages always available; clear value demonstration in top journeys; A/B testing to validate improvements
Circuit breakers per backend; graceful degradation to cached data or traditional pages; clear messaging ("This information is temporarily unavailable")

What This Approach Does Not Solve
 Content quality: AI can only surface what VA has published; outdated or incomplete content will still surface
 Policy complexity: Eligibility rules remain complex; AI makes them more accessible but cannot simplify underlying policy
 Backend limitations: If a VA system doesn't support an operation, AI cannot enable it
 Universal adoption: Some Veterans will always prefer phone or in-person service

Questions for VA
 Scope prioritization: Which of the six core journeys (Search/Learn, Apply, Status, Appointments, Documents, Messaging) should be prioritized for initial deployment?

 Identity infrastructure: Should the AI Assistant integrate with existing VA.gov authentication flows, or is there interest in exploring enhanced identity proofing capabilities?

 Content governance: Who within VA would own Tier 0 content approval? Is there an existing content governance process we should align with?

 ATO pathway: Does VA prefer a standalone ATO for the AI Assistant, or integration into an existing system boundary?

 Success metrics: Beyond task completion rates, what outcomes would VA consider evidence of success for this initiative?

Deep experience with eligibility rules, scheduling, case management

VA Ecosystem Experience
Since 2015, Kevadiya has developed and operated VetRide (powered by TransTuitiveTM), a mission-critical platform coordinating Veteran transportation for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This decade of VA experience directly informs our approach:
 Operated within VA's security and compliance environment -- achieved Authority to Operate (ATO) in 2016 and maintained continuous compliance
 Scaled from pilot to national operations -- grew from ~150 vehicles to 1,500+ vehicles supporting 3 million trips annually
 Integrated with VA systems -- connected to VA scheduling, eligibility, and administrative systems
 Learned the operational realities -- orchestration across roles (Veterans, caregivers, schedulers, dispatchers), governance requirements, and the criticality of graceful degradation

Relevant Experience- TransTuitive -- Paratransit & Demand-Response Platform
Our flagship platform, TransTuitive, serves transit agencies managing complex, multistakeholder operations. It serves:

 Riders -- Individuals with disabilities booking and tracking trips

 Caregivers -- Family members or case workers managing trips on behalf of riders

 Call Center Representatives -- Handling phone-based booking and inquiries

 Dispatchers -- Managing real-time operations and vehicle assignments

 Supervisors -- Monitoring performance and resolving exceptions

 Administrators -- Configuring eligibility rules, service areas, and policies

While smaller in scale than VA.gov, it addresses remarkably similar challenges:

Dimension Multi-step workflows
Eligibility complexity
Role-based delegation Integration with legacy systems Real-time status across systems

VA.GOV Challenge Apply for benefits, appeals, enrollment Service history, discharge status, ratings Caregivers acting for Veterans
VistA, BGS, MPI

3. Integration Normalization  Adapters for multiple scheduling engine vendors  Canonical trip/rider/vehicle models  Graceful degradation when backends unavailable
4. Comprehensive Audit  Every booking, cancellation, and modification logged  Rider activity history for case workers  Compliance reporting automation
The screenshots below demonstrate that we have already implemented Dynamic UI in TransTuitive to help operations teams complete high-frequency tasks in complex, dataheavy workflows. In each example, an operator uses natural language to express intent (e.g., "pull vehicles," "pull passengers," "pull today trips"), and the system responds by rendering a schema-driven, validated UI view of the relevant records, guiding the user to review and explicitly confirm selections before any downstream processing occurs. This mirrors the pattern we propose for VA.gov: reduce cognitive load, keep interactions taskfirst, and enforce deterministic, auditable execution for actions that affect real people and mission outcomes.
Operators use a chat command (e.g., "pull vehicles") to generate a validated Dynamic UI result set from live operations data. The agent returns the matched count and guides the user to confirm the exact records via checkboxes before any bulk action proceeds, keeping execution deterministic and auditable.

Operators run a natural-language query (e.g., "pull passengers") and the system renders a schema-driven list of matched passenger records (PII-aware). The agent supports review + selection through explicit checkbox confirmation, enabling safe downstream actions without auto-editing sensitive records.
Operators request "pull today trips" and the platform produces a Dynamic UI view of the day's trip workload (time/location/status cues). The agent narrows the working set and requires human confirmation (checkbox selection) before executing dispatch, messaging, or batch processing steps.

Lessons Learned -- Directly Applied to This Proposal

Lesson Start with top journeys Normalization unlocks UX
Progressive disclosure works
Delegation is essential Graceful degradation builds trust Audit enables accountability

TransTuitive Experience
80% of calls were booking + status; optimize these first
Unified trip model hid scheduling engine differences
Riders didn't need full policy manual; show what's relevant
Case workers needed full rider visibility with consent
"Booking unavailable, try again" beats system crash

VA.gov Application Focus on Search, Apply, Status before full platform Unified status model hides claims/appeals/health differences
Veterans don't need all eligibility rules; show their situation
Caregivers need Veteran visibility with consent "AI unavailable, traditional page available" beats error

FTA auditors could trace any trip decision

VA oversight can trace any claim/action
