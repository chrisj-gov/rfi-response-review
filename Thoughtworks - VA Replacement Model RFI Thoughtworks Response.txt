For the VA.gov replacement model, we bring a set of clear strengths that directly align to VA's needs:
 Experience in VA enterprise ways of working - we have partnered with VA digital service leaders and product teams across OIT, OCTO, and VHA to deliver modern Veteran and clinician experiences and understand the complexities of the organizational ecosystem, the multi-vendor environment, and ways of working for effective service and product delivery.
 Designled, journeyfirst thinking backed by engineering excellence - we start from Veteran journeys and service outcomes, then engineer platforms that can actually deliver them reliably.
 AIfirst software delivery - we use agentic, AIaccelerated methods (such as our AI/worksTM platform) to move faster and reduce risk in building, refactoring, operating, and continually modernizing complex systems, instead of bolting AI on top.
 Enterprise platform, data, and operations modernization - we treat VA.gov as a living product and platform: continuously modernized, observable, and governed, not a onetime rebuild.
Below are the Thoughtworks capabilities most relevant to this opportunity.
Agentic, AIaccelerated software engineering (AI/worksTM)
We apply an AIfirst approach to software delivery, using AI/worksTM to reshape how we understand, design, and build the systems behind VA.gov.
Concretely, this means:
 Rapid prototyping: Use AIassisted generation of interaction flows, screens, service stubs, and test data from draft requirements and journey maps so VA teams can see and exercise thin slices of the future VA.gov experience in days or weeks instead of months.
 Reverse engineering and system understanding: AI agents analyze existing applications and codebases (including complex legacy and mainframeadjacent systems) to map behavior, dependencies, and business rules.
 Dynamic specification and superspecs: requirements and domain knowledge are synthesized into living, machinereadable specifications that align product, design, and engineering.
 Spectocode generation with guardrails: highquality code, tests, and infrastructure definitions are generated from those specifications, under strict governance, security, and quality controls.
For VA.gov, this allows us to accelerate modernization and integration of the services behind the site while maintaining strong traceability, code quality, and compliance - directly supporting VA's need to derisk change while moving faster.
Mainframe and legacy modernization for derisking change
Many of the systems that shape the VA.gov experience sit behind legacy and "bedrock" platforms. Thoughtworks' Enterprise Platform Modernization work focuses on these kinds of estates, including mainframe and large monoliths, using patterns such as stranglerfig, façade services, and eventdriven integration.
Applied to VA.gov, this means:
 Progressive extraction of highvalue capabilities from legacy systems into modern, APIfirst services that can power new VA.gov journeys.
 Sidebyside coexistence of old and new flows, with routing and fallbacks that protect Veterans from disruption.

 Use of AI/worksTM to shorten analysis and refactoring cycles, so modernization is driven by clear business and experience priorities, not by technology alone.
This gives VA a credible path to "evergreen" backend capabilities that support the new VA.gov experience without risking a bigbang cutover.
Continuous modernization and operations (DAMO + AI/worksTM)
Our Digital Application Management & Operations (DAMO) offering is designed for organizations that need their digital front doors to be alwayson, alwaysimproving. For a futurestate VA.gov, DAMO would:
 Provide 24x7 monitoring, incident management, and reliability engineering for key VA.gov journeys and shared services.
 Enable regular, lowrisk releases of content, UI, and backend changes, so VA can respond quickly to policy changes, new benefits, or emerging Veteran needs.
 Leverage AI/worksTM capabilities in operations (e.g., codebase regeneration, automated remediation of known issues, intelligent analysis of incident patterns) to keep the platform secure and current.
Together, DAMO and AI/worksTM support VA's requirement for continuous modernization: VA.gov gets better every month, not every few years, while preserving continuity of service for millions of users. Seamless Government Experience (SGX)
Thoughtworks possesses extensive experience collaborating with numerous public sector entities internationally, encompassing state, local, and U.S. federal levels. This engagement has resulted in the refinement of our repeatable and proven methodology for designing governmental digital workflows and web presences centered on the constituent, rather than predicated on the organizational structure of a government agency. We have maintained an uncompromising focus on architecturally inverting the platform to guide audiences through necessary information, precisely when it is required, in a manner that is both intuitive and highly accessible.
We incorporate embedded Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents to facilitate the execution of workflows, the surfacing of relevant information, and the development of tailored experiences based upon a user's specific requirements. This approach instantiates a "no wrong door" philosophy, thereby ensuring a commitment to directing a Veteran to the necessary resource, irrespective of their point of entry or navigation path within the platform.
VA.gov would significantly benefit from the adoption of this philosophy, given the broad spectrum of services, offerings, and needs that the platform must accommodate. Thoughtworks has successfully implemented award-winning solutions of this caliber for organizations of comparable scale globally.

Replacement Model for VA.gov
Thoughtworks' understanding and strategic alignment
VA's objective and context
VA's objective is to deliver a premier, modern, secure, Veterancentric digital front door that brings together benefits, healthcare, memorial, and related services in a single, coherent VA.gov experience. The futurestate VA.gov should feel as intuitive and trustworthy as the best commercial digital properties Veterans use every day, mobilefirst, responsive, accessible, and easy to navigate for users of all digital literacy levels.
VA.gov is a missioncritical channel at international scale, backed by a complex ecosystem of "bedrock" and legacy systems and operating in a highly regulated, highvisibility federal environment. Today, the platform is supported by a decentralized network of teams, stakeholders, budgets, contracts, and vendors. Any replacement model must therefore:
 Maintain and steadily improve continuity of content and availability of service.  Integrate safely with a diverse portfolio of existing systems.  Embed security, privacy, and accessibility into the architecture, design, and delivery model from
the outset.  Enable contributors, developers, and stakeholders across the enterprise to integrate and maintain
their missions/offerings.
Vision for a Modern VA.gov
Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors must be able to confidently trust VA.gov as their primary digital front door - a place where they can reliably get what they need, when they need it. The site should reflect VA's mission and values as dependable, transparent, and focused on delivering benefits, care, and information that Veterans deserve.
Future-state VA.gov must be a one-stop, unified experience that brings together benefits, health care, memorial and other services behind a single, coherent entry point. It must be intuitive and accessible for Veterans of all levels of digital literacy, with clear language, guided flows, and design that goes beyond compliance to truly support users with disabilities or constrained connectivity. The experience should feel as modern as the best digital services Veterans use every day, including mobile-first, responsive, and app-integrated journeys that work seamlessly across devices.
To achieve this, the VA.gov platform must enable continuous modernization and design unification across its entire web estate, not one-time rebuilds. VA.gov must evolve without ever putting critical services or information at risk. Changes should only make key tasks easier to discover and complete, never harder. On the back end, program offices, product technical teams, and contractors, need coherent, well-governed platform, tooling, and publishing workflow so they can keep content and services accurate, current, and secure at scale, in line with VA's broader goal of delivering a seamless, unified Veteran experience through state-of-the-art technology.
VA has articulated several key constraints for the VA.gov replacement effort. The following section summarizes these constraints and explains how Thoughtworks proposes to address them within the replacement model.

Key Constraint Continuity of service for millions of users
Integration with diverse legacy and emerging systems
Regulated, highly visible federal environment
Long-term scalability, adaptability, and resilience
Need for a more seamless customer experience

Mitigation
Design for incremental modernization and coexistence - run legacy and new experiences sidebyside, use progressive routing and feature flags, and validate new journeys against current baselines before full cutover. Implement robust performance engineering, active monitoring, and SLOs so changes only move forward when they maintain or improve uptime, latency, and error rates (requiring 0% degradation of current service levels).
Introduce a unified integration layer (API gateway + eventing) that wraps legacy systems behind stable, standardsbased contracts. Use patterns such as stranglerfig, facades, and eventdriven integration to progressively move functionality into modern services while legacy systems continue to operate. Enforce canonical data models and contract testing so frontend teams can evolve experiences without being tightly coupled to each backend change.
Embed zerotrust aligned security, privacy, records, and accessibility into architecture and delivery from the outset, not as afterthefact checks. Use FedRAMP/FISMAaligned cloud controls, leastprivilege access, encryption in transit/at rest, and robust audit logging. Build accessibility into design systems and CI/CD pipelines (automated checks plus human testing with assistive tech) so every change is secure and accessible by default.
Modernize toward a modular, serviceoriented platform with autoscaling, multiAZ/region deployment, and robust observability to handle growth and incidents. Improve authoring, publishing, and configuration workflows so program offices and technical teams can quickly and safely update content, rules, and configurations, keeping experiences accurate and resilient as policy and demand evolve.
Ensure the experience is accessible, mobilefriendly, and forgiving, with guided flows, clear plainlanguage copy, and patterns that work across devices and digital literacy levels. Treat navigation, search, and content strategy as firstclass citizens: redesign information architecture and search to make critical information and tasks easier to discover and complete, and guard against regressions so no journeys or content "fall through the cracks" during migration (e.g., redirects, content mapping, analyticsdriven validation of findability and task completion).

Organizational Considerations & Strategy
Thoughtworks understands that modernizing VA.gov is far more than a technical redesign; it is fundamentally an organizational change management effort. VA.gov is a critical enterprise-wide platform supported by numerous independent teams, each with unique workflows, data sources, and commitments. Therefore, a successful replacement model must go beyond just swapping the front end. It requires a holistic strategy that addresses the underlying organizational complexities and the specific operational landscape of the VA. Our approach focuses on designing middleware and adapting back-end systems to seamlessly accommodate the needs of these diverse teams, ensuring long-term sustainability and consistency.

©2026 Thoughtworks, Inc. Confidential. All rights reserved | 2

To facilitate this crucial organizational alignment, the new platform must empower the development teams who interact with it daily. This enablement is achieved through capable tooling, a highly modular design, and guaranteed interoperability. By focusing on a superior developer experience, we can ensure that distributed teams can easily and consistently update the web presence and integrate their information under a unified, journey/experience-driven scheme. Thoughtworks has a proven history of managing this kind of complex, enterprise-level digital transformation, where technology is the enabler for comprehensive organizational and process change.
Guiding Principles for the Replacement Model
Based on VA's mission and constraints, Thoughtworks recommends the following guiding principles:
 Veterancentric and outcomefocused: Center experiences on Veteran needs and life events, making it easier to access and complete tasks tied to benefits, healthcare, and services.
 Experienceled, not technologyonly: Treat UX and service outcomes as firstclass concerns alongside architecture and security; decisions about platform and integration exist to support better Veteran journeys.
 Continuitypreserving modernization: Modernize incrementally to preserve service continuity for millions of users and respect existing dependencies, avoiding bigbang cutovers.
 Integrated yet modular: The future VA.gov should feel unified ("central entry point," "across all benefit portfolios") while remaining capable of integrating with a broad portfolio of legacy and emerging systems, suggesting a modular but wellintegrated architecture.
 Secure, compliant, and trustworthy: Operating within a regulated, highly visible environment implies that security, privacy, compliance, and public trust are nonnegotiable and must be embedded throughout the design and delivery approach.
 Scalable, adaptable, and resilient by design: Engineer for scale, change, and resilience over the long term so VA.gov remains evergreen rather than requiring periodic reinvention.
These principles are realized through three tightly integrated dimensions: Veteran-facing journeys, a modular platform and integration architecture, and content, governance, and analytics, fitting together into a single replacement model for VA.gov.
Integrated Solution Approach: Experience, Platform, and Content
Across multiple publicsector clients, Thoughtworks has developed and delivered a seamless government experience (SGX) approach: constituentjourneyfirst, platformbacked, and datainformed.
The patterns are directly applicable to VA.gov:
 Veteranjourneyfirst design: organize the digital experience around life events and tasks ("file a claim," "manage my care," "understand my education benefits"), with "nowrongdoor" entry and clear status throughout.
 Modular digital platform: provide shared capabilities for identity and authentication, navigation, content, forms, notifications, search, and analytics that can be reused across benefit portfolios, while integrating with existing VA systems via APIs and, where needed, intelligent adapters.
 Embedded analytics and experimentation: instrument key journeys, measure outcomes (task completion, time to complete, errors, call deflection, satisfaction), and use that data to guide an ongoing roadmap.

For VA.gov, this translates into a Veterancentric, omni-platform-ready, and unified entry point that can be upgraded incrementally, backed by a platform and operating model designed to support VA's scale, regulatory environment, and longterm digital transformation goals.
Veteran-Centric Experience Design and Journeys
Through our Seamless Government Experience (SGX) model we propose moving VA.gov toward an intent-driven ecosystem where Veterans can intuitively find the answers they need and navigate their benefit journeys. By implementing experience-led navigation, we enable Veterans to manage complex life journeys seamlessly, surfacing the full breadth of VA services contextually while preserving access to critical information.
Each administration and office within VA contributes to the robust services used by Veterans throughout their lives. Creating the ability to bring these services together within a navigational framework will provide valuable experiences for Veterans.
These journeys are architected around the specific user persona - whether Veteran, caregiver, or dependent - orchestrating disparate VA systems into a unified path toward successful outcomes. For instance, in high-stakes life events like welcoming a new child or facing illness and subsequent sudden loss of income, our proposed model integrates many VA services provided by different administrations ensuring the Veterans spend less time 'data mining' for benefits and more time receiving the support they've earned.
Partnering with VA Product Owners, our cross-functional teams utilize continuous Veteran research to co-design accessible, high-validity digital journeys. We guarantee 'built-in' accessibility by embedding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines standards into our core requirements and testing. By aligning with VA-specific tools and security policies throughout the software delivery life cycle, we deliver optimized experiences for all literacy levels, devices, and physical abilities. Our mission is to ensure that Veteran needs and VA operational rigor are prioritized from discovery through deployment.
These Veteran journeys will be available in an unauthenticated state but secure login is at the heart of this new experience to give the Veteran a more accurate view of the benefits they qualify for and allow the experience to transcend user sessions. We will coordinate closely with the VA's Next-Generation Digital Identity team to make sure this login process is smooth, secure, and consistent.
Platform Architecture and Technology Approach
The role of the platform is to make these Veteran journeys safe to change and easy to extend. The architecture behind VA.gov must allow VA to introduce new, unified experiences while existing systems continue to run reliably, enabling incremental modernization instead of risky bigbang replacement.
Target architecture overview
Target architecture should be aligned with the experiences and journeys presented to Veterans. We recommend implementing a hybrid modernization strategy that delivers immediate impact through a greenfield experience and interface backed by an API Gateway and Event Mesh, while incrementally strangling legacy systems behind façade APIs. This enables VA.gov to modernize Veteran interactions without risking business continuity, while laying the foundation for modular, interoperable services.
Legacy systems would be transitioned domain by domain using a Strangler-Fig pattern, which employs a dual-run, read-shadow/write-through validation, streaming data pipelines, and a Master Data Management hub to establish canonical entities for key entities, which map closely to the journeys. This approach eliminates batch blackouts, reduces vendor fragmentation, and supports phased decommissioning with minimal disruption. For Veterans and caregivers, this means faster, more reliable digital interactions and the confidence that improvements to VA.gov will not break the services they already depend on.

The target architecture will be modular and service-oriented, governed by enforceable open standards across all areas. The frontend would follow a micro frontend pattern, while leaning heavily on VA's Design System (VADS) for continuity across the interface. In addition, cross-cutting services will be created around identity integration, content delivery, search, analytics, and observability.
AI based tools will be leveraged as accelerators to reconcile data, detect anomalies, and LLM-assisted tools to translate policy changes into system updates, ensuring modernization moves faster, at lower risk, and with greater adaptability. In particular, Thoughtworks AI/worksTM agentic development platform allows Thoughtworks engineers to utilize AI to reverse engineer legacy systems, do dynamic spec development, and provide spec-to-code capabilities, as well as runtime operations. This accelerates the legacy modernization and getting to the target architecture, while also enforcing guardrails and governance for AI-assisted development in a federal environment.
Integration with legacy and emerging VA systems
An integration strategy of establishing an API Gateway and Event Mesh as the single contract layer across all VA.gov systems significantly reduces complexity. Legacy systems are wrapped with façade APIs, enabling real-time event-driven data exchange and eliminating brittle point-to-point and batch integrations. Where overlap exists, commodity services can be consolidated into shared components, while specialized vendor systems remain until phased retirement is viable.
To ensure multi-vendor interoperability, enforce open standards (REST/JSON, AsyncAPI, schema registry) and embed conformance testing directly into DevSecOps pipelines. Governance is federated but enforceable: VA defines the canonical models vendors must adhere, and automated validation ensures compliance. An integration control board coordinates vendors and provides leadership with transparency through real-time dashboards on service levels, data quality, and compliance.
All AI services operate through secure APIs within FedRAMP environments and adhere to VA's data access and privacy policies. This model creates a unified, resilient ecosystem that simplifies vendor coordination, standardizes interoperability, and ensures real-time, trustworthy data flows across VA's benefits and healthcare portfolios.
Security, privacy, resilience
Because VA.gov is a lifeline for many Veterans, this modern platform cannot compromise resilience and security. Our security, privacy, and resilience approach embeds Zero Trust Architecture, FedRAMPaligned cloud controls, and NIST 80053 safeguards into every layer of the system so that Veterans experience a secure, alwayson site without unnecessary friction in their daily tasks.
For the security architecture, utilize robust architecture patterns that include Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). While enforcing MFA tightens up the security, it is important that Veterans have a seamless user experience by implementing single sign-on (SSO) functionality leveraging VA's identity systems. We will also utilize the FedRAMP-authorized cloud environment to meet federal security standards and elevate the overall security posture.
Related to Zero Trust Architecture, modernizing VA.gov requires integration across multiple systems spanning multiple agencies. Every interconnection bears a risk and therefore, must have a highly secure baseline of foundational controls and contextual threat modeling. We recommend implementing a Zero-Trust model that assumes that no Veteran or device - whether inside or outside the VA network - can be trusted by default. This model requires continuous verification for every access request, regardless of where the request is coming from. Therefore, security is not defined by location but is integrated into every layer of the system, including the network, cloud infrastructure, and application layers. Micro-segmentation and strict access controls are key in limiting what a user or application can access, even after they have been authenticated. Micro-segmentation is a complex and granular process which
©2026 Thoughtworks, Inc. Confidential. All rights reserved | 5

involves defining security policies, enforcing them, and also continuously monitoring and refining them. Leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate the implementation of these defined policies.
Security should be integrated into every layer of the system, setting a security built-in mindset. Network security will involve firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, while cloud infrastructure will utilize cloud-native security tools for continuous monitoring and compliance. A DevSecOps approach is key for application security, which embeds security into the development pipeline from the beginning, including automated code reviews and vulnerability scanning.
For data protection, preventing sensitive data from getting into the wrong hands, security measures are imperative for both data at rest and in transit, aligned with the NIST 800-53 standard. For data in transit, mandate TLS/SSL encryption so that information moving across systems remains confidential at all times. All data at rest should be encrypted using strong encryption such as AES-256. This way, all information stored in any form (database, logs, etc.) will be protected at all times. Furthermore, ensure there is a comprehensive audit log available to monitor access and change.
On reliability and resilience, implement VA.gov's modernization for 99.99%+ availability of critical transactions, aligning directly with NIST 800-53 control families for Contingency Planning (CP), System and Communications Protection (SC), and System and Information Integrity (SI). This architecture uses multi-Availability Zone and multi-region active-active deployments (CP-10, CP-11) with global DNS routing (SC-5, SC-6) to eliminate single points of failure. Stateless microservices operate within an autoscaling service mesh (SC-7, SC-24), protected by circuit breakers, bulkheads, and rate limiting (SC-6, SC-23, SC-32) to contain faults and shield critical Veteran benefit, healthcare, and account flows during VA.gov surges or other anomalies.
Data resilience should be maintained through synchronous multi-AZ replication and asynchronous cross-region backups (CP-6, CP-9, CP-10), ensuring RPOs under 60 seconds and RTOs under 15 minutes. Idempotent APIs, durable message queues, and reconciliation processes (SC-26, SI-7, SI-12) guarantee transaction integrity under retries and protect against partial failures. In the event of a component outage, systems automatically failover to alternate regions (CP-7, CP-10), while any Veteran submissions are persisted and acknowledged immediately (SI-12), ensuring no disruption to critical domain processing. Non-essential functions degrade gracefully, allowing core services to remain operational (SC-24).
Reliability is continuously monitored (CA-7) through unified logging, metrics, and traces (AU-6, AU-12), along with synthetic transactions to verify uptime. Define SLOs and error budgets per product and enforce escalation playbooks (SI-4, IR-4) when thresholds are exceeded. Independent verification and validation (IV&V) reviews confirm compliance with FISMA and validate recovery playbooks annually (CP-4, CA-2). To ensure operational readiness, conduct annual contingency plan testing with the VA (CP-4, CP-9), exercising recovery scenarios under realistic loads. For Veterans and their families, this translates to a VA.gov experience that remains available and responsive even under stress, with their data protected and their most important tasks, such as checking benefits, managing care, and updating contact information, consistently prioritized. By embedding product teams with clear accountability for uptime SLOs across domains like benefits eligibility and enrollment, claims and appeals, and digital health services, VA's systems gain resilience as a continuous responsibility, not a one-time project deliverable.
Content Strategy, Governance, and Analytics
Even the strongest architecture and security will fall short if Veterans can't find clear, trustworthy information. The following content, governance, and analytics approach makes VA.gov a simple, authoritative source of truth and continuously improves journeys and platforms using realworld data.
©2026 Thoughtworks, Inc. Confidential. All rights reserved | 6

Content and information architecture
An effective content strategy for VA.gov's modernization must move beyond keyword optimization and treating content as a volume or traffic exercise, evolving into a holistic, scalable system that reinforces VA's brand, satisfies real Veteran intent, and supports longterm technical growth. Modernization should start by tightly aligning content to VA's outcomes such as the Veteran experience and retention, grounded in a clear understanding of the life events each asset serves, why it exists, and how it delivers measurable value. We recommend a comprehensive audit of existing content to reduce bloat, prune underperforming content, refocus on answering concrete Veteran questions when they come to VA.gov, and clearly define VA's brand and authorship so search engines and AI systems recognize the site as a coherent, authoritative entity.
Architecturally, modern content strategies favor structured topic ecosystems over flat blog libraries: organizing content into topic clusters with comprehensive pillar pages and tightly related subtopics so Veterans and systems can understand semantic relationships and navigate complex domains. Thoughtful internal linking then reinforces these relationships, distributes authority across the site, and improves crawlability without relying on adhoc navigation.
Recommended CMS solutions are ones where developers define reusable templates rather than custom code for individual URLs, so thousands of pages can be created with builtin scalability and consistent VA branding and structure across topic ecosystems, without requiring a developer for every page. The CMS should also provide nocode capabilities so VA content teams can independently update content, metadata, and internal links, and it should be implemented as a scalable headless CMS that separates the content repository from the frontend display to maximize site speed, flexibility, and user experience across devices.
Content operations and governance
Content production must prioritize credibility and differentiation in an AIsaturated environment, emphasizing firsthand experience and subjectmatter expertise through clear authorship and credible sourcing. Content should deliver genuine information and gain original insights, data, or perspectives beyond summaries and be structured to answer questions clearly and directly, so it performs well in answer engines and AIdriven discovery experiences that favor concise, authoritative responses.
Scalability depends less on tools than on governance and disciplined workflows: clear ownership of the content lifecycle, standardized templates for repeatable page types, and early collaboration between VA leadership, product teams, and engineering to avoid fragmentation and technical debt. Measurement must also evolve, looking beyond rankings or traffic to visibility in AIgenerated answers, impact on Veteran journey paths, and contribution to Veteran experience and retention. Continuous maintenance, refreshing, validating, and retiring content ensures VA.gov content remains a trusted, continuously managed VA asset, not a onetime deliverable.
Analytics, measurement, and continuous improvement
We recommend modern analytics platforms that consolidate data from all operational systems into a unified, governed environment, so portfolio, compliance, and performance data are consistently available for predefined reports and adhoc queries across all programs. On top of this, VA should use enterprisegrade BI and visualization tools with embedded rolebased access controls to derisk technical debt, automate required portfolio and compliance reporting, and provide interactive dashboards and selfservice analytics (including SQL interfaces) without relying on IT for every request.
For advanced analytics, we see leading AI/ML platforms such as Databricks or AWS SageMaker (aligned to VA's hosting and FedRAMP constraints) supporting predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and portfolio risk scoring at scale, with models retrained on schedules tied to data refresh, seasonal patterns, and policy changes. Together, this architecture creates a unified, secure, scalable analytics environment
©2026 Thoughtworks, Inc. Confidential. All rights reserved | 7

that automates routine reporting, enables flexible adhoc and predictive insights, and ensures the right data reaches the right stakeholders at the right time to drive effective decisionmaking.
Implementation, Operating Model, and Risk Management
A Veteranjourneyfirst, modular platform only delivers value if implemented without disrupting current VA.gov users. Our phased modernization and productcentric operating model introduce thinslice capabilities, measure impact, and scale what works while managing risk across stakeholders and systems.
Phased Modernization and Migration Strategy
Implementation
Thoughtworks proposes an incremental and de-risked approach to platform engineering that prioritizes low-risk, high-value execution to meet the strategic requirements for VA.gov. Our approach is centered on aligning modernization efforts directly with business objectives, which is essential for unlocking innovative technology opportunities while methodically reducing risks across the entire initiative. This commitment ensures that we not only meet the current needs but also build a foundation for future evolution.
Our phased modernization and migration strategy is structured to protect the continuity of service while steadily improving the Veteran user experience (UX). It encompasses high-level phases such as discovery and alignment, establishing the platform and design foundation, piloting initial high-value journeys, and finally, a scaled rollout. A core component of this is a progressive routing and co-existence strategy, utilizing beta experiences, redirect management, and clear decommissioning patterns, to allow the new and old systems to operate simultaneously. This incremental migration is further de-risked and accelerated by our use of AI/works-style reverse engineering and code regeneration, which supports a faster understanding of legacy code paths and enables the safer, more granular extraction of services to feed the new VA.gov platform.
Operational model
Thoughtworks' product-centric operating model - our approach to structure, governance, prioritization and measurement which connects strategy to delivery - is designed for iterative, outcome-focused delivery, directly implementing the digital front door that the VA seeks. Project governance will be structured to ensure that the goals of this transformational project are consistent with enterprise standards set by the VA's Web Governance Board (WGB) and the Web Communications Office (WCO).
Before modernization efforts began, we recommend being intentional with Conway's Law to assess the current state of how teams are set up across the entire VA.gov ecosystem, including the existing VA.gov Platform Team, and identifying any constraints and unintended friction points. Using the `Inverse Conway Maneuver', VA can identify a roadmap for evolving the teams and organizational structure within VA.org to promote the desired target end state / architecture. Aligning the organizational structure with the technical architecture ensures the system architecture evolves intentionally, with team structure reinforcing, rather than undermining, the modernization goals.
We will:
 Organize Product teams aligned to customer or user journeys (VA + industry partners) to ensure end-to-end ownership and a consistent focus on delivering value at every stage.
 Execute agile/lean delivery with an automation first mindset.  Drive a centralized, cross-functional governance body including joint reviews at the portfolio and
workstream levels.

Virtual Agent Chatbot (Self-Service & Accessibility) We didn't just build a bot; we built a trusted interface. Through research with 50+ Veterans, including inclusive design studies with blind Veterans, we created a 508-compliant tool that reduces contact-center load by allowing Veterans to self-triage and check claim status. AskVA: We moved the front-end experience of the existing service to VA.gov, with Veteran research ensuring the usability and 508 compliance as primary requirements. We also ensured the complex routing of Veteran questions to CRM specialists within the legacy backend.. VA.gov Impact: The VA chatbot is the epitome of HCD, while demonstrating 508 compliance as well as ensuring integration with an existing VA solution.
Clinician-Centered Design & Rapid Modernization CDS Console and AI Scribe To improve Clinician efficiencies with VA clinical decision systems, we built the console which connects a clinician to over a dozen applications they use daily within an SSO experience. To continue to fight clinician burnout, we integrated AI ambient scribing into the hybrid VistA/Oracle ecosystem, launching the new capability from the console. By building a FHIR-compliant integration layer, we moved from discovery to live pilots in months, a speed stakeholders noted was unprecedented. VA.gov Impact: This reflects the architectural backbone of a modern VA.gov: secure identity, token exchange, and standards-based FHIR integration along with the rapid, incremental introduction of AI enablement to Clinicians. It demonstrates VA and Thoughtworks' ability to move from concept to production pilots quickly while maintaining compliance and safety, critical for derisked modernization of VA.gov and its supporting services.
COVID-19 Patient Manager (CPM) We built a SMART-on-FHIR clinical decision support tool that bridged the gap between VistA and Cerner. This award-winning tool helped ER physicians make life-saving decisions using real-time data. VA.gov Impact: Thoughtworks leverages a "Thin Slice" delivery model, which was applied here tackling vertical segments of a solution, reducing time to impact, while improving high-risk, high-complexity domains quickly without disrupting ongoing modernization.

SGX BEACON
Reference Link: https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/digital-transformation/how-ai-enables-accessible-government-for-citizens
In partnership with the State of Illinois and Google Public Sector, Thoughtworks helped design and implement BEACON, a youth behavioralhealth portal built on the Seamless Government Experience (SGX) platform. BEACON provides families and caregivers with a single digital front door to discover and access behavioralhealth services that were previously scattered across multiple departments and program websites.
Using SGX on Google Cloud, the team integrated resources and workflows from six state agencies into a single, guided experience, moving from concept to MVP in roughly six months. Instead of forcing families to understand government org charts or navigate agencyspecific portals, BEACON applies a "nowrongdoor" model: users answer a small set of questions about their situation and are routed to appropriate programs, supports, and community resources, regardless of which agency technically owns them. Behind the scenes, SGX orchestrates multiagency data and eligibility rules, while Google Cloud services (including analytics) help Illinois monitor demand patterns and continuously refine the experience.
VA.gov Impact: BEACON is a concrete example of how the SGX pattern can solve the same multiagency, nowrongdoor orchestration challenge VA.gov faces across benefits and healthcare. Like Veterans and caregivers, Illinois families don't care which agency is responsible; they care about getting to the right help quickly. BEACON shows that a platformfirst, lifeevent-oriented design, running on a modern cloud stack, can unify services from many organizations into a single, humancentered journey, without replacing every underlying system at once. Those same patterns (shared platform, thinslice MVP in months, progressive integration of additional programs) are directly applicable to building a unified, Veterancentric VA.gov front door atop VA's diverse portfolios and partners.
Life.Gov.SG - Singapore's citizen portal
GovTech Singapore partnered with Thoughtworks to create LifeSG (formerly Moments of Life), a Strategic National Project under the Smart Nation initiative that gives citizens a single comprehensive mobile app for governmentrelated activities across key life stages, instead of navigating many separate apps and websites. The work began with the Young Parents/Families journey, mapping all touchpoints from birth to age six and bundling services such as birth registration, Baby Bonus benefits, vaccinations, passports and preschool search into coherent flows that reduce administrative effort and make next steps clear for parents.
To shape LifeSG, Thoughtworks and GovTech conducted comparative analysis of solutions like GOV.UK and local portals, identifying three core pain points: silos of information and processes, poor discoverability, and lack of awareness, and led a GovTech team to conceptualise and validate ideas with more than 100 citizens. Thoughtworks, selected for its design leadership, agile ways of working and product strategy, helped design the LifeSG concept: a dashboard of critical governmentrelated information, an inbox for upcoming tasks and timely updates, a topically organised library of policies, information and transactions, and personalised pushes of services, creating onestop access to government information and eservices that GovTech is now implementing and extending to additional life moments. Within Singapore's broader digital government stack, LifeSG complements platforms like Singpass as the citizenfacing layer for lifeevent journeys and crossagency APIs, embodying the "one app for citizen milestones" vision of a seamless, digital Singapore.

VA.gov Impact: LifeSG demonstrates Thoughtworks' ability to design and deliver a single, lifeevent-oriented front door on top of many agencies, services, and legacy processes - exactly the kind of "nowrongdoor" experience VA is seeking for VA.gov. By unifying dozens of child and familyrelated services into guided, mobilefirst journeys, LifeSG shows how we reduce fragmentation, improve discoverability, and make next steps clear without replacing every underlying system at once. The same patterns: crossagency APIs, lifestage dashboards, task inboxes, and personalized guidance, are directly applicable to organizing VA benefits and healthcare journeys across VHA, VBA, and NCA into a coherent, Veterancentric digital experience.
Gov.UK - UK's citizen portal
Reference Link: https://www.thoughtworks.com/clients/government-digital-service
The UK Government Digital Service (GDS) partnered with Thoughtworks to design, build, and evolve GOV.UK into the single digital front door for central government services, replacing more than 1,000 fragmented departmental websites with a unified, easytouse platform.
This consolidation addressed issues of inconsistency, confusion, and duplicated effort by giving citizens one trusted place to find information and complete tasks, regardless of which department owned the underlying service.
Working over a sevenyear partnership, Thoughtworks helped GDS take a product and platformled approach: implementing a cloudhosted, modular architecture, introducing modern engineering practices (automated testing, monitoring, CI/CD), and enabling multiple teams to deploy changes safely several times per day instead of once every few months.
GOV.UK became the UK's first major cloudhosted public website, saving approximately £70 million by merging legacy sites and supporting more than six million unique visitors per week and 1,000+ publishers within a year of launch.
Building on this platform, Thoughtworks and GDS also delivered GOV.UK Verify (a federated digital identity service) and the Performance Platform (public dashboards showing usage, completion, cost, and satisfaction), further standardizing how citizens securely access services and how government teams monitor and improve them.
VA.gov Impact: GOV.UK demonstrates at national scale what the VA.gov Replacement Model seeks to achieve for Veterans: one secure, reliable, experienceled front door sitting on top of many departments, systems, and policies. The GDS case shows that a platformfirst, productdriven modernization strategy can:
 Consolidate hundreds of disparate sites into a single, coherent experience without disrupting underlying lineofbusiness systems.
 Use cloud infrastructure and CI/CD to deliver safe, frequent change at scale, rather than rare, highrisk releases.
 Provide a reusable foundation for crosscutting capabilities (identity, analytics, notifications) that multiple services can plug into over time.
