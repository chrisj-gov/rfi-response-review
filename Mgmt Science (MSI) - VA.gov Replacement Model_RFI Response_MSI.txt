Our Understanding of VA's Needs: Centering the Veteran in Digital Transformation
Team MSI understands that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not merely looking for a website refresh, but a total evolution of its digital flagship to move beyond traditional transactional interactions to a more anticipatory service model. We recognize that for the Veteran, the "system" is often viewed as a single entity; therefore, any friction in navigation or authentication reflects on the VA's broader mission of care and service to its constituents (including Veterans, service members, and their families and caregivers throughout their lives. Team MSI's approach acknowledges that this transformation is a high-visibility effort requiring the maintenance of service continuity for millions of users while simultaneously implementing a modern architecture.
To truly improve and redefine the user experience with VA.gov, emphasis needs to be foremost on simplicity and replicating a human-to-human experience. A Veteran-centric design must account for the diverse needs of the stakeholder community and address the collective experience of all users, ranging from tech-savvy younger Veterans to older retirees who may require specific accessibility

considerations to the family members and caregivers who frequently interface with VA.gov on behalf of Veterans. For each of these unique users, accessing VA.gov should be as seamless as if they had a VA caseworker sitting side by side with them, walking them through the process to ensure they get the information they need and that no question goes unanswered. The goal is to provide a best-in-class online experience that serves as a secure and intuitive entry point for healthcare, benefits, and services. From initial sign-in to the delivery of benefits and services, every digital touchpoint must reinforce trust and accessibility. The section below details Team MSI's understanding of these critical outcomes that the VA is seeking to achieve through the replacement of VA.gov.
Minimize Administrative Burden on Veterans and Caregivers: Team MSI recognizes that one of the most significant non-technical pain points for Veterans is the time tax, or the cumulative burden of navigating complex authorization requirements and processing delays. Veterans often wait months for benefits to be processed, and the confusion surrounding disability claims or healthcare appeals remains a top complaint. A premier digital experience must do more than just digitize forms; it must actively reduce this burden by:
 Anticipating User Needs: Move from a reactive model to a proactive one that uses data to alert Veterans of eligible benefits before they even apply and minimize the number of interactions they must have with the system (whether that be through VA.gov, contacting their local VA hospital, etc.) in order to get what they need.
 Eliminating Silent Failures: Address critical system gaps where submitted forms fail to reach downstream systems without alerting the user, an issue that has impacted tens of thousands of claims in recent years.
 Streamlining External Care: Improve the maze of processing requirements that makes private providers hesitant to accept VA benefits, thereby expanding the real-world healthcare options available to Veterans.
Improve Accessibility and Close the Digital Divide: While modernizing VA.gov, Team MSI understands that the VA must prioritize the millions of Veterans with service-connected or general disabilities. Recent audits have shown that many critical VA IT systems still fall short of Section 508 compliance. Furthermore, a significant portion of the Veteran population (particularly older adults and those in rural areas) faces a digital divide characterized by limited broadband access and lower digital literacy. To be truly Veteran-centric, the new model must:
 Ensure Universal Accessibility: Move beyond "vendor self-declarations" and implement rigorous, continuous 508-compliance testing throughout the development lifecycle.
 Support Human-Centered Design: Incorporate direct feedback from Veterans with vision, hearing, or cognitive impairments to ensure the navigation is orienting rather than confusing.
 Prioritize Plain Language: Determine what the most common knowledge gaps are among users and ensure that information is readily available and easily digestible by a wide audience.
 Design for Low-Bandwidth Environments: Ensure that the site remains functional and performant for Veterans who lack high-speed internet, modern devices, or general technological literacy.
Reduce Technical Debt and Cultural Risk Aversion: Team MSI understands that failed IT modernization efforts are often tied to high levels of technical debt, or the accumulation of outdated code and unsupported platforms. Additionally, a culture of extreme risk aversion within federal agencies can lead to change fatigue, where employees and users alike perceive new technologies as a threat rather than a tool. This rings particularly true for a large and complex site such as VA.gov that is managed by numerous product manager and developers who feel a strong sense of ownership - and perhaps protectiveness - over the current system. A replacement strategy for VA.gov must address these organizational pain points by:
2

 Implementing Agile Governance: Move away from "big bang" releases in favor of smaller, iterative updates that demonstrate time to value quickly.
 Managing the "Make/Buy" Tension: Assist the VA in assessing when to build custom solutions versus procuring commercial-off-the-shelf products to minimize future technical debt.
 Fostering a Culture of Innovation: Provide the necessary training and change management to ensure that VA staff feel empowered, rather than overwhelmed, by the transition to new digital tools. Reinforce the message that the new system is for the benefit of the entire organization and user community and foster a sense of collective ownership among developers and product managers to facilitate buy-in.
Break Down Data Silos and Interoperability: A core challenge in replacing VA.gov is the fragmentation of data across the enterprise. The VA operates within a diverse portfolio of legacy and emerging systems. Currently, these disparate systems often create data silos where Veteran information, such as medical records, disability ratings, and education benefits, exists in isolation. These silos prevent a truly seamless customer experience because they require the Veteran to repeatedly provide the same information via multiple channels or navigate different interfaces for different services. The Veteran wants and needs to interact with the VA as one entity.
Team MSI understands that a successful replacement model must implement a unified data layer that breaks down these barriers. This involves creating a platform architecture that facilitates real-time data exchange between portfolios while adhering to federal security regulations. By centralizing the view of the Veteran, the VA can provide a single source of truth, allowing for personalized navigation where the website remembers the Veteran's status and proactively offers relevant services, thereby fulfilling the mandate for a more integrated digital experience.
Improve Data Cleanliness and Governance: Closely tied to the challenge of silos is the issue of data cleanliness. Team MSI recognizes that the effectiveness of the new VA.gov is directly dependent on the quality of the underlying data. Years of legacy operations across multiple departments can lead to redundant, obsolete, or trivial data, as well as inconsistent data formats. If the data is dirty, even the most modern front-end interface will fail to provide accurate information to Veterans, leading to frustration and erosion of trust. Our understanding of the VA's scope includes the necessity of a rigorous data governance and strategy effort that involves:
 Data Normalization: Ensure that Veteran identity and benefit data are standardized across all integrated systems to prevent authentication errors or benefit delays.
 Deduplication: Resolve conflicting records that may exist between healthcare and benefits databases to ensure the Veteran sees a consistent profile.
 Scalable Architecture: Build a system that maintains data integrity as it scales to support millions of concurrent users and evolving benefit portfolios.
Ensure Continuity of Service and Risk Mitigation: Team MSI acknowledges that the VA cannot "turn off" the current site to launch the new one - the modernization must happen while maintaining 100% service continuity. We understand the risks and tradeoffs involved in such a transition, particularly regarding identity proofing and secure sign-in. Our approach incorporates lessons learned from past large-scale federal and private sector deployments to ensure that the transition is phased, tested, and resilient. By focusing on experience design, platform architecture, and a robust operating model, Team MSI is prepared to help the VA transition to a resilient and adaptable digital experience that meets the high standards our nation's Veterans deserve.
Our Technical Approach
Unlike traditional government contractors focused primarily on compliance and technical requirements, Team MSI leads with human-centered design that drives measurable outcomes including increased enrollment and higher user satisfaction. When we invest in better experiences, we

aren't just improving usability - we're advancing equity, unlocking efficiency, and rebuilding public trust. That's not just a nice-to-have, it's mission-critical.
Digital transformation in government too often stops at surface-level digitization carried out by scanning PDFs, launching microsites, or checking compliance boxes. Real modernization demands more. It means rethinking workflows, re-architecting systems, and rebuilding experiences from the ground up with the Veteran at the center and the mission in clear focus. Team MSI doesn't simply digitize existing processes, we modernize and optimize them from the ground up. Our approach is grounded in experience-led transformation that puts the user at the center of every design decision. We bring full-stack capabilities spanning strategy, design, content, technology, change management and communications under one roof, eliminating the coordination overhead that slows traditional multi-vendor projects.
Team MSI brings full-stack capabilities, from strategy through implementation, ensuring seamless execution by a balanced team of engineers, business analysts, and creatives. We deliver front-end development with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Next.js, combined with responsive design that works beautifully across devices. Our back-end development spans Node.js, Python, and Java environments. We handle database design and optimization for performance at scale. DevOps and infrastructure automation enable rapid, reliable deployments. We also use proprietary AI tools, from persona-led research to real-time contextual design, always with data ethics and transparency at the core.
The section below outlines our multi-faceted approach to helping VA deliver the digital experience our nation's Veterans deserve - one that maintains continuity of service while fundamentally improving usability, accessibility, and trust in government.

Identity Proofing and Authentication

Navigation and Information Architecture

Security is critical, but authentication shouldn't become a barrier. We design workflows that balance strong identity verification with usability, providing multiple pathways for identity proofing including online, in-person, and assisted options. Our systems support credential recovery when Veterans lose access, integrate seamlessly with Login.gov and other trusted identity providers, and clearly communicate security measures to build trust rather than create anxiety. Continuity and Trust Veterans depend on VA.gov for critical services such as healthcare appointments, disability claims, education benefits. Any disruption can have serious consequences. Our phased modernization approach maintains service continuity throughout transformation. We favor progressive enhancement rather than big-bang replacement, running systems in parallel during transition periods. Extensive testing and validation occur before any cutover, with clear communication to Veterans about what's changing and when. We build easy rollback capabilities into every release for risk mitigation, ensuring that if issues arise, we can quickly restore service. We learned from Healthcare.gov's troubled launch, and numerous other major failed government systems, that transformation must be steady and reliable. Our approach delivers continuous improvement while maintaining the trust Veterans place in VA services.

We design navigation that reflects how Veterans think about their needs, not how VA is organized internally. Our information architecture is taskoriented rather than organization-oriented, using progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users. We maintain consistent patterns across benefit portfolios so Veterans can transfer their learning. Smart defaults based on Veteran profile and history reduce cognitive load, while clear pathways accommodate both common and edge cases. User Feedback We capture implicit feedback from user behavior and provide explicit feedback mechanisms through ratings and comments. Machine learning improves relevance over time, while A/B testing validates personalization strategies. Continuous refinement based on outcomes ensures the system gets smarter with use. We share learnings across benefit portfolios so improvements in one area benefit Veterans accessing other services. Personalization isn't about creating more work for Veterans - it's about making their experience easier by remembering context, respecting their time, and adapting to their needs. Done right, personalization rebuilds trust by showing Veterans that VA values their individual circumstances and is working to serve them more effectively.

Platform Architecture

Our technical approach balances modern best practices with the realities of VA's complex technical

environment. We bridge the gap between legacy constraints and cloud-native possibilities through a

decoupled, API-first architecture. This approach ensures high availability and scalability while enabling us to

modernize critical services incrementally without disrupting the continuity of care Veterans rely on.

Microservices

Headless Content Management System

Monolithic systems create cascading failures when one component breaks. Our microservices approach decomposes functionality into independently deployable services, enabling teams to work in parallel without blocking each other. We can selectively scale high-demand services while leaving others at baseline capacity. This architecture facilitates gradual modernization, because there's no need to rebuild everything at once. When issues do occur, the impact is contained to individual services rather than bringing down the entire platform.

Content must flow seamlessly across channels. We implement a headless CMS that decouples content from presentation, allowing the same content to appear appropriately formatted on web, mobile, voice, and other channels. Content modeling supports reuse and consistency across touchpoints. Workflow tools enable distributed content teams to collaborate effectively. Preview and staging environments provide quality control before publication. API delivery enables true omnichannel content distribution.

Veterans receive information through numerous channels, and we ensure consistency across all of them. Email notifications include clear calls to action. SMS updates deliver time-sensitive information to mobile phones. In-app messaging reaches logged-in users at the moment of relevance. Print materials serve those who prefer or require physical documents. We coordinate closely with VA contact centers so phone agents have the same information as digital channels. Social media integration extends reach where appropriate.

We establish a content ownership model with clear responsibilities for creation, review, and maintenance. Editorial calendars and workflow tools coordinate distributed content teams. Content performance metrics track readability, findability, and task completion rates. A/B testing enables continuous optimization based on evidence. Regular content audits identify outdated or underperforming content for updates. A comprehensive style guide and content standards ensure consistency across pages.

Sustainable transformation requires the right operating model, not just during initial delivery, but for ongoing

evolution. In an agency with as much organizational complexity as the VA, there must be clear governance

structures in place, with empowered product owners who can make tactical decisions quickly while ensuring

strategic alignment with the broader goals of the transformation initiative.

Continuous User Feedback Loops

Clear Decision-Making Frameworks

Usability testing occurs throughout development, not just at the end. Beta programs with Veteran volunteers provide real-world validation before full release. Analytics and user behavior tracking reveal how Veterans actually use the system versus how we expected. Support ticket analysis identifies pain points that surface after launch. Regular surveys and feedback mechanisms capture sentiment and suggestions. Advisory groups representing diverse Veteran populations provide ongoing guidance on design decisions.

Transformation stalls without clear decision authority. We establish RACI matrices that define who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each type of decision. Escalation paths resolve blockers quickly when teams cannot reach consensus. Regular steering committee meetings provide executive oversight without micromanagement. Authority is delegated to appropriate levels so teams can move quickly on tactical decisions while leadership focuses on strategic direction. Transparent decision documentation ensures everyone understands the rationale behind key choices.

Change Management and Adoption

New technology only succeeds if people adopt it. Our change management approach begins with stakeholder

engagement and communication plans that prepare people for what is coming. We provide comprehensive

training for VA staff on new systems and processes. Support materials and resources help Veterans navigate

changes. Phased rollout allows for adjustment based on early feedback before full deployment. Success

Case Study #5: Educational Testing Service - A Future-Ready Transformation

Challenges Educational Testing Service (ETS), a standardized testing giant and trusted solutions organization, sought to support their evolved strategic vision by showcasing a compelling overview of their business. To position themselves for successful B2B growth and bolster their reputation globally, ETS needed a comprehensive brand transformation. Looking to grow their B2B business, ETS faced significant hurdles posed by emerging challenges and everevolving technological advancements disrupting the testing and assessments industry. Although well-known, the overall corporate brand lacked a clear mandate and equity.

A VA website must reflect traditional elements of service while meeting its digital branding strategy goals for human-centered design, personalization, and accessibility. This ETS project demonstrates our ability to position a complex organization as a pathbreaker beyond its core mission and setting the brand up for success across different business models (B2B, B2C, B2G). As the VA embarks on expanded services (e.g., AI-powered care), it would benefit from a partner who has helped businesses successfully market and expand their services.

In a community-amid environment, we positioned ETS as a pathbreaker in an evolving landscape. We reimagined ETS's brand identity system and digital experience, including a redesigned logo and digital platform. The new branding symbol, an upward diagonal, represents progress, ascending as a bold centerpiece, created by an upward diagonal that superimposes ETS's commitment to advancing the science of measurement to power human progress.
Results
 +888% user growth with ETS Solutions, their new B2B arm
 100% accessibility score at launch per Google Lighthouse
 +12% positive sentiment for the new ETS and TOEFL brands
