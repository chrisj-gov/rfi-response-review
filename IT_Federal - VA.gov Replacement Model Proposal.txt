IT Federal Sales is proud of its history as a service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB) technology solution provider to federal customers since August 2005. We have maintained a GSA MAS since June 2007 and have established a stellar reputation with both industry partners and government customers and an exceptional record of performance.

Executive Introduction: About Liferay and Why It Matters for VA.gov Modernization The Department of Veterans Affairs' vision for the VA.gov Replacement Model is a modernization program of exceptional scale and visibility. VA.gov is not simply a public-facing website; it is the Department's primary digital entry point for benefits, healthcare, services, and information. Meaningful improvement requires coordinated modernization across experience design, platform architecture, content strategy, governance, analytics, and operating models--while maintaining continuity of service for millions of users and operating within a regulated federal environment.  Liferay, Inc. is a global Digital Experience Platform (DXP) vendor purpose-built for mission-critical enterprise websites and authenticated portals in government and highly regulated industries. Liferay's flagship product, Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP), supports enterprise web publishing and digital service delivery in a single governed platform, combining modern content management with workflow automation, role-based experiences, integration patterns, and operational governance.  Importantly, Liferay's relevance within VA is demonstrated in practice: Liferay is the platform powering the My HealtheVet experience on VA.gov, supporting secure authenticated Veteran healthcare journeys. This is directly aligned to the Replacement Model's critical need to deliver identity-aware, service-oriented experiences at scale without disruption.  Liferay's strategic focus on the public sector--including the U.S. federal ecosystem--further supports the VA's objectives. Liferay is designed for organizations that must meet accessibility mandates, enforce content governance, integrate across complex enterprise portfolios, and sustain long-term scalability and resilience. Liferay's partner ecosystem, including IT Federal Sales and leading federal systems integrators, reinforces a delivery model aligned with federal program execution and lifecycle support.  In addition to deployment credibility, Liferay has received independent analyst recognition. In Gartner's 2025 Critical Capabilities for Digital Experience Platforms research, Liferay achieved the highest ranking in the "Authenticated Experience" use case--validating Liferay's core strength in secure, role-aware digital journeys that mirror VA.gov's most critical functional requirements.  In summary, Liferay DXP provides a strong foundation for VA's replacement model by enabling VA to modernize as an enterprise website and an authenticated digital service platform--supporting phased transformation, continuity of operations, and long-term adaptability at federal scale.

1. Understanding of VA Objectives and Replacement Model Considerations IT Federal Sales and Liferay understand that VA is seeking industry input on technologies, approaches, and best practices that can fundamentally improve the digital experience across benefit portfolios. The Replacement Model must maintain continuity of service, integrate with a diverse systems landscape, operate in a regulated federal environment, and remain scalable and adaptable over the long term.  Liferay DXP supports these objectives by providing a governed enterprise web platform that is capable of simultaneously supporting broad public information delivery and secure authenticated service journeys. The platform is well suited for phased replacement strategies where VA can modernize portfolio-by-portfolio while maintaining stability and minimizing risk.
Highlighted Alignment to VA Objectives
 Continuity of service supported through phased rollout models and multi-site governance  Secure authenticated journeys supported through role-aware experiences and integration patterns  Strong governance and content operating model controls to improve consistency across portfolios  Long-term scalability and resilience through modular, extensible architecture
2. Liferay DXP Capabilities for Enterprise Websites and VA.gov-Scale Operations Liferay DXP is designed for enterprise website programs that require consistent user experience, structured content reuse, strong editorial workflows, and scalable operations across multiple sites and program teams. For VA.gov, these capabilities support both the public experience and authenticated service delivery.  Key capabilities include modern content management with structured content types, reusable components, page templates, publishing workflows, and governance controls. These enable VA to standardize experiences while enabling distributed teams to deliver content rapidly under controlled approvals and auditability.
Key Capabilities and value for VA.gov
 Enterprise content reuse: reduce duplication and improve consistency across benefit portfolios  Workflow and approvals: enforce governance without slowing delivery  Component-based design systems: accelerate delivery and reduce UI fragmentation  Multi-site management: operate VA.gov as a coordinated enterprise ecosystem

3. Experience Design, Accessibility, and Veteran-Centric Outcomes VA's digital services must meet high standards for accessibility and usability. Liferay provides strong support for accessibility-first design and enterprise UX patterns. The platform is compatible with modern front-end approaches and supports responsive, mobile-first experiences.  The platform's personalization and segmentation capabilities can support Veteran-centric experiences that adjust content and journeys based on role, eligibility, preference, and intent signals, improving self-service success rates while ensuring consistent governance.
4. Platform Architecture, Integration, and Legacy Modernization Approach VA's environment requires integration across many legacy and emerging systems. Liferay is frequently deployed as an integration-centric experience layer, enabling unified experiences that connect to multiple back-end systems via APIs, services, and event-driven patterns. This supports modernization without requiring replacement of all legacy components at once.  This architecture aligns to VA's need to deliver a seamless digital front door while allowing portfolios and underlying systems to modernize on independent timelines.
5. Governance, Operating Model, and Analytics Enablement VA has recognized that modernization is not solely technical. Liferay supports the governance and operating model maturity needed for an enterprise-scale web program. Capabilities include role-based editorial permissions, structured workflow, staging environments, audit logging, and enterprise reporting.  These controls allow VA to increase speed and quality simultaneously: accelerating content operations while improving consistency, compliance, and visibility into bottlenecks, throughput, and performance.
6. Liferay Roadmap
Liferay is continuing to build Liferay DXP into a scalable, extensible, and cloud-native platform that empowers organizations to navigate digital transformation for the challenges of today--and tomorrow. Consistent with this investment strategy, Liferay's published roadmap emphasizes improvements that help agencies modernize with confidence while sustaining continuity of service and adopting new delivery models over time.
VA's VA.gov Replacement Model will benefit from a platform committed to continuous investment in the areas most critical to federal-scale digital service delivery, including security and identity, content operations at enterprise scale, modular extensibility, performance, and cloud-native operational readiness.
IT Federal Sales Response to VA Solicitation # 36C10B26Q0131

 Strategic roadmap focus areas include:
 Security and identity enablement to strengthen secure authenticated experiences and facilitate integration with enterprise identity ecosystems.
 Operational governance enhancements to workflows, approvals, delegated administration, and content lifecycle controls to support distributed publishing models with centralized oversight.
 Extensibility and composability improvements that reduce reliance on heavy custom code while increasing reuse of standard components across sites, portfolios, and teams.
 Cloud-native scalability and operability, including ongoing investments in performance, resiliency, and deployment flexibility to support high-scale mission environments.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a strategic roadmap dimension for Liferay DXP, particularly for improving content operations, searchability, and end-to-end efficiency in digital experience delivery. As federal agencies scale digital engagement and content velocity, AI-enabled tooling can reduce manual effort, improve consistency, and accelerate time-to-publish while maintaining governance controls. Examples of how AI fits within Liferay DXP include:
 AI-driven content operations enhancements such as recommendations and improved discoverability of assets and related resources.
 AI-assisted translation workflows to streamline multilingual publishing across large content libraries.
 AI image generation to accelerate production of digital assets for pages and campaigns.  AI-powered content creation assistance to help authors draft and refine content faster
while adhering to tone and editorial standards.
