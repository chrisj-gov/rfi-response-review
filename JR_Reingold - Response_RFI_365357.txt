Executive Summary & Strategic Vision
Architectural Strategy: Transitioning to an Intent-Driven Platform. Today, Veterans are forced to adapt themselves to the organizational structure of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to access benefits. For over a decade, VA.gov has functioned as a passive library--a repository where the burden of discovery rests entirely on the user. We propose a fundamental inversion of this model: VA must adapt to the Veteran. By transitioning to an intelligent, intent-driven platform, we move from a site where Veterans must search for help to one that anticipates their needs, removing the administrative friction that acts as a functional denial of service.
A Veteran in rural Montana on a legacy device cannot wait for heavy pages to load. And a Veteran transitioning to civilian life should not be greeted by a generic directory, but by an intelligent dashboard that anticipates their immediate needs. VA does not need another website update; it needs a fundamental shift in how it serves Veterans through its digital front door.
Reingold is a full-service digital transformation firm headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia. For over 35 years, we have partnered with the federal government on mission-critical platforms, including VA Pulse, MyHealtheVet, Travel.State.Gov, Census.gov, and Military OneSource, delivering identity, authentication, and experience solutions that bridge legacy systems with modern user expectations.
We propose the Intelligent Veteran Experience Platform (iVXP). Recognizing that no single monolithic platform can solve VA's complexity, iVXP connects the best tools available rather than forcing a single, rigid system. We use Adobe Experience Cloud as the proactive service layer, while seamlessly integrating with critical legacy infrastructure (VistA, VBMS) and Salesforce service cloud. This approach evolves the current passive content management system (Drupal) into an active, data-driven architecture that predicts Veteran needs before they click, and makes VA.gov do the work, not the Veteran.
Strategic Recommendation: Reingold notes the concurrent release of RFI Notice ID 365357 ("Exploring Next-Generation Digital Identity..."). We strongly recommend merging the scope of these two opportunities. A truly personalized Veteran experience is impossible to decouple from identity. By combining the identity with the experience platform into a single contract, VA eliminates vendor friction, reduces integration risk, and ensures that the unified Veteran profile is secure from the moment of authentication.
To validate our vision for this response, we invested in fresh, proprietary research for this RFI. Our findings confirm that for a significant portion of Veterans, identity hurdles and navigational dead ends act as a functional barrier to entry, forcing them to rely on third-party workarounds to access benefits. In January 2026, we surveyed 50 Veterans across eras to capture the unfiltered reality of their digital experience--from "rabbit hole" searches to the anxiety of waiting on claims. We combined these immediate insights with our 15 years of operational history within VA to propose a solution that targets the actual friction Veterans face today. Our vision for iVXP is focused on the following:
Centering the Design on the Veteran. We propose shifting the information architecture from an organizational hierarchy to a life-event model. This ensures the platform aligns with the Veteran's actual service journey--transition, health management, or retirement--rather than forcing them to understand VA's program offices. Through dynamic personalization, we'll keep the Veteran front and center by tailoring content and experiences to what they need at any given time. The platform will also build on the current foundation of patient engagement in secure messaging apps and the MyHealtheVet platform, so that Veterans can continue to take more control of their care via the array of virtual health technologies available to them.
Ensuring Long-Term Agility. We use a modular, decoupled architecture rather than a rigid monolithic suite. This approach creates a future-proof foundation that allows VA to integrate emerging technologies incrementally and swap out individual components as needed without disrupting core services or incurring massive technical debt.
The Imperative. VA.gov must no longer be merely a website; it is the primary interface for the government's promise to Veterans. Decisions made in this solicitation will define that experience for a

over decade. While incremental improvements will perpetuate friction, our unified, intent-driven platform fundamentally changes how Veterans access care.
Strategic Rationale: The Best-in-Breed Advantage We selected a best-in-breed architecture to resolve a fundamental tension in government technology: platforms designed for secure case management are architecturally ill-suited for high-speed experience delivery, while standard content management systems lack the logic for complex transactions. A monolithic approach forces the VA to compromise on either public performance or backend capability. Our best-in-breed strategy avoids this vendor lock-in trap by assigning specific workloads to the engines best engineered to handle them.
Edge Delivery vs. Traditional CMS Latency. Sixty percent of VA.gov traffic consists of anonymous users querying external search engines. Traditional CMS platforms struggle here because they force a central server to "build" the page after the Veteran clicks, utilizing heavy code that drags down mobile performance. We use Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Edge Delivery Services (EDS) to invert this model. Instead of making the Veteran wait for a central server, EDS pushes lightweight, pre-rendered content to servers geographically closer to the user.
 Operational Impact: A 26-year-old recently separated Veteran searching for "Post-9/11 GI Bill rates" on a mobile device in a rural area needs an instant answer. Because EDS serves this content from the "edge" of the network rather than a distant data center, the page loads in sub-seconds. This captures the user immediately, preventing the bounce rates common with slower, all-in-one government portals.
System of Record vs. Content Management: Upon login, the focus shifts from experience delivery to service delivery. Standard CMS platforms cannot handle complex case processing without significant customization. We avoid this risk by separating experience delivery from benefits and claims workflows, using Salesforce Government Cloud as the service system of record and keeping the complex logic where it belongs.
 Operational Impact: When that same Veteran applies for benefits, the system transitions to service workflows. His inputs are routed through Salesforce Government Cloud for processing, while eligibility is evaluated by VA systems of record to ensure security and accuracy without embedding business logic in the CMS.
The Ecosystem Advantage. We selected Adobe Experience Cloud as the experience backbone precisely because halfmeasures fail at enterprise scale. This unified platform eliminates the "integration tax" (the brittle middleware and custom code) that hinders most government digital transformations. By using a natively integrated stack, we achieve seamless data flow and consumer-grade performance without the fragility of duct-taped point solutions.
Our Solution: The Intelligent Veteran Experience Platform
From Static Content Management to Real-Time Data Orchestration
Replacing VA.gov is not simply a change of content management systems. It is a comprehensive redesign of how Veterans access, engage with, and benefit from VA services. Reingold proposes the Intelligent Veteran Experience Platform (iVXP), a modular ecosystem designed to engage Veterans on the specific devices and channels they use daily, anticipate their needs, and maintain the integrity of VA systems of record. iVXP consists of three integrated layers, each with a specific role:
 Veteran Experience, which defines what Veterans see and interact with.  Veteran Engagement, which delivers proactive and tailored communication beyond the website.  Veteran Profile, which responsibly unifies identity, behavior, and context.
This layered architecture provides operational resilience and long-term agility, while avoiding the risks inherent in a monolithic platform.
The Vision: It is 2030. A 22-year-old specialist separates from service at Fort Campbell. By the time he arrives home, his VA.gov dashboard has already ingested his service records to populate a ready-to-file disability claim for his documented injuries, GI Bill rates for local colleges matching his MOS, and a confirmed primary care appointment. He never searched for a form; the platform anticipated the need.
Simultaneously, a Vietnam Veteran with Parkinson's disease receives a notification: his recent clinical data qualifies him for increased homebound support. His caregiver confirms the in-home assessment with one tap. No paperwork, no "burden of proof." Just service delivered.

VETERAN EXPERIENCE: High-Performance, Personalized, and Accessible by Default.
The Veteran Experience layer is the digital front door of iVXP. It is where Veterans interact with VA.gov across anonymous discoveries, authenticated sessions, and during critical life moments. This experience is

powered by Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Edge Delivery Services, with Adobe Target enabling purposeful, measurable personalization. Together, these technologies deliver fast, resilient, and adaptive experiences without compromising accessibility, security, or trust.
Zero-navigation goal. To eliminate the need for manual navigation, iVXP employs Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to surface resources based on intent rather than keywords. If a Veteran types "I can't pay my rent," the system immediately prioritizes the HUD-VASH program rather than a generic list of housing pages. Crucially, this intent engine serves as a safety net: if the system detects acute distress signals (e.g., "want to hurt myself"), it anonymously activates a prominent "Get Help Now" component. This offers an immediate connection to the Veterans Crisis Line without logging an adverse event, ensuring Veterans can seek information safely without fear of flagging their permanent record.
Performance as a baseline requirement. Veterans accessing care and benefits should never be limited by bandwidth, geography, or technology constraints. AEM Edge Delivery Services (EDS) provides sub-second page loads for both unauthenticated and authenticated users, with automatic adaptation for low-bandwidth and legacy devices so critical content remains accessible under unideal conditions. In iVXP, performance is a prerequisite for equitable access, not an optional enhancement.
Personalization at scale. iVXP uses Adobe Target to customize pages and dashboards based on session context, Veteran profile, and recent interactions, rather than relying on static navigation and generic menus. The platform highlights the most relevant information and enables zero-navigation experiences for frequent tasks, allowing Veterans to access information and complete common actions seamlessly. For example, a Gulf War Veteran identified via Southwest Asia theater service records will see immediate prompts for Airborne Hazards Registry tasks and PACT Act presumptive condition screenings, while less relevant initial transition or education content is suppressed. Similarly, a Veteran with an active claim will see claim status displayed prominently upon login, eliminating the need to search or call. Crucially, when a claim status is surfaced, iVXP manages the anxiety of waiting by providing context and explaining that gaps between updates are typical during review stages, so Veterans know their file hasn't been lost.
Personalization in iVXP is applied responsibly, regularly evaluated, and continuously improved. Adobe Target enables controlled A/B and multivariate testing to ensure changes enhance the user experience without introducing friction. As Veterans interact with VA.gov over time, the content and layout adjust to show the most useful information.
 Adaptive Homepage: The moment a Veteran logs in, the generic homepage updates to match their profile. For example, a Veteran in the "Transitioning from Service" cohort sees a dashboard focused on Education Benefits and Employment Tools.
 Survivor Support: A Veteran family member in the "Survivor" cohort (identified via dependent status) sees immediate access to Survivors Pension and burial benefits, removing the pain of searching for these sensitive topics.
Session continuity and local relevance. Beyond personalization, iVXP supports continuity across sessions. Veterans can start an interaction with VA.gov on one device and continue on another later without losing progress, reducing frustration during complex use cases. The experience layer also adapts to local context, automatically displaying relevant resources. These features ensure VA.gov meets real-world needs, not just static user profiles.
 Location-Based Resource Tiles: Unlike legacy tools limited to internal VA facility lists, iVXP ingests external data sources to identify the nearest accredited VSO partners and community resources alongside VA Medical Centers. This ensures Veterans connect with their complete local ecosystem.
 Local Alerts. Content and navigation adapt to the world around the Veteran. For example, during regional emergencies like wildfire warnings, the site overrides standard content to prioritize emergency pharmacy refill protocols and disaster assistance resources for Veterans in affected areas, ensuring the Veteran receives actionable safety information without searching
VETERAN ENGAGEMENT: Proactive, Respectful, and Veteran-Centered.
The Veteran Engagement layer extends iVXP beyond the website to ensure Veterans feel supported before, during, and after their interactions with VA.gov, enabling VA to move from reactive outreach to timely, effective communication.

Because iVXP is modular by design, we will collaborate with VA to recommend the most suitable engagement platform, such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud or Adobe Journey Optimizer, following a structured assessment. We will drive this selection based on a deep analysis of your current workflows, constraints, and pain points. Both platforms support omnichannel outreach and integrate with iVXP; the final selection will prioritize interoperability, cost savings, and, most importantly, the effective deployment of consistent, reliable engagement for Veterans.
Timely and personalized communication. iVXP supports targeted outreach through channels such as email, SMS, and push notifications, triggered by real-time audience signals rather than relying on pre-scheduled campaigns. Communications are aligned to a Veteran's profile, action, status changes in their benefits or claim cases, and more. For example, a Veteran may receive a notification when a claim moves to a new review stage, or email with guidance when additional documentation is needed to complete a benefit application. Communication channels and content are governed by Veteran preferences, so that iVXP can provide personalized, timely support without overwhelming Veterans.
Life-event-oriented engagement journeys. In addition to timely, situational communication, iVXP supports ongoing engagement journeys oriented around key life events. These journeys deliver coordinated communication over time, helping Veterans understand what to expect. For example, a Veteran transitioning from service may receive a structured series of messages covering education benefits, employment resources, and VA health care enrollment in a clear sequence after separation, eliminating the need to search for these benefits in silo. Similarly older Veterans might receive an aging-in-place journey that combines health services, pension benefits, and memorial planning into one cohesive view, hiding the bureaucratic lines between VHA, VBA, and NCA so the Veteran sees only one VA. This approach ensures continuity and minimizes confusion and missed steps in complex processes.
Responsive communication during uncertainty. iVXP enables timely outreach during unexpected circumstances and events, helping Veterans stay informed and feel supported during periods of uncertainty. For example, if a regional inclement weather affects in-person appointments, Veterans in the area will receive clear, proactive updates with guidance on alternative options and available support. By communicating quickly and transparently, iVXP demonstrates reliability, driving Veterans to VA.gov for truth rather than leaving them to navigate social media rumors forums.

AI-assisted benefits navigation. To resolve complex benefits questions without human intervention, iVXP employs a multi-step AI framework that coordinates various specialized reasoning components (or "agents"). Each agent uses a combination of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), third-party tools, dynamic skills files, and strict guardrails to synthesize Veteran-specific data with authoritative VA policy documents to generate precise answers. For instance, if a Veteran asks, "What does my 70% rating mean?," the system does not return a generic link to a pay table. Instead, it calculates their specific compensation based on the rating decision and cross-references their profile to identify service gaps. If the system detects the Veteran is not yet enrolled in VA healthcare, it proactively prompts the application. This capability resolves complex, Tier 1 informational queries instantly, directly reducing the inbound volume to National Call Centers.

VETERAN PROFILE: A Unified, Interoperable, and Privacy-first foundation
At the core of iVXP is a data and profile layer that powers both experience and engagement without replacing or compromising VA systems of record. This layer is built on Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), which serves as the experience data backbone for the ecosystem.

AEP collects behavioral, engagement, and content interaction signals from both the Experience and Engagement layers. Through its Real-Time Customer Data Platform (RT-CDP), these signals are merged with Veteran information from VA record systems to create an evolving, unified profile. RT-CDP then conduct AIenabled audience segmentation and activation, enabling VA to continuously understand, anticipate, and address Veterans' needs.

Respecting systems of record. Veteran records, including identity, benefits, health, and claims, remain securely stored in VA systems of record such as MPI, VBMS, VistA, and CARMA. iVXP does not replace or duplicate these systems. Record updates are securely transmitted and used only to enhance experience and engagement. We will implement strict data lifecycle management and data minimization protocols to ensure records are not

stored beyond experience activation and that VA maintains full control of Veteran data through role-based permission for security, accountability, and compliance.
Transparency and trust by design. Data usage by iVXP is transparent and adjustable. Veterans have visibility into exactly how their information is used to improve their experience and have clear control to manage their preferences. We apply Privacy-by-Design principles and limits data usage to what is necessary and permitted by individuals, ensuring responsible data handling and activation for the sole purpose of enhancing the Veteran experience.
Portable service credentials. To modernize proof of service, iVXP extends the Veteran Profile to support W3C Verifiable Credentials. Rather than relying on static PDF downloads, the platform mints a cryptographically signed digital DD-214 at the point of separation. This "Self-Sovereign Identity" model allows Veterans to store their credentials in a secure mobile wallet and share them instantly via API with verified third parties--such as mortgage lenders, employers, or state DMVs. This architecture eliminates the latency of manual record requests and mitigates the risk of document forgery.
Veteran-Centric Research & Co-Design
Enterprise-Scale Discovery for the Total Veteran Population
Replacing VA.gov requires solving a fundamental split in the Veteran community. Our January 2026 initial research confirms that while some Veterans find the current site "improved by leaps and bounds," a significant portion remain completely locked out, stating, "I have never been able to create an account." To bridge this gap, we propose a research approach capable of gathering and acting on data from thousands of touchpoints.
Nationwide Representation: We move beyond the beltway bubble by maintaining active research panels that statistically reflect the entire Veteran population. We stratify testing cohorts by Service Era (Vietnam to Post9/11), Branch, Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), and Length of Service. This ensures the platform is validated against the operational realities of the total force--from Rural Veterans navigating low-bandwidth environments to those managing complex service-connected disabilities or accessing specialized benefit portfolios. We will provide monetary incentives for participation consistent with industry best practices for market research.
Longitudinal Diary Studies: To understand the friction Veterans face when navigating such a comprehensive network of resources, our research looks past the initial login to study their repeated interactions and long-term usage patterns. We follow a cohort of 500+ Veterans as they attempt to create their accounts, file claims, schedule appointments, and manage medications. We will ask research participants to log in to a video-based UX research platform whenever they access the website to screenshare and narrate on camera their impressions, experiences, and pain points in navigating site functionality. This reveals the invisible work and waiting periods (sometimes spanning months) that can occur between clicks.
Testing for Real-World Friction. Standard usability testing often assumes a calm user with a perfect memory. Real life is different. Our research highlights simple hurdles, like changing a phone number or resetting a password, become major barriers to entry.
 The Login-Loop Test: We specifically test account recovery flows with Veterans who have outdated phone numbers or lost credentials. This validates that security measures do not accidentally become exclusion measures.
 Cognitive Load Testing: We go beyond standard usability to test navigation performance under constraints. We simulate high-stakes scenarios (e.g., housing insecurity) alongside testing with cohorts experiencing service-connected neurocognitive impairment (e.g., TBI or PTSD). This validates that workflows remain navigable even when a Veteran's executive function--the ability to retain information and process complex steps--is temporarily or permanently compromised.
Validating Navigation and Usability. Qualitative feedback must be backed by quantitative rigor.  Tree Testing at Scale: Veterans reported that links often lead down information silos with no clear guidance, or recommendations they talk to their healthcare provider to learn more. To fix this, we conduct large-scale tree-testing studies. We watch how Veterans categorize services to build an Information Architecture (IA) based on their mental models, not VA's org chart. While Veterans are

the main focus, we also test how VA staff engage with the site and confirm technical and clinical requirements for increasing site efficiency and value of content for this audience.  A/B/n Testing for Engagement: We test thousands of variations of imagery, micro-copy, and video integration to statistically determine which combination yields the highest engagement and trust scores.
The Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE) Method Extensive research will not slow us down. We use the RITE Method, where research cycles are compressed into 1-week sprints.
 Monday: Prototype a new life event journey (e.g., "Retiring from Service").  Tuesday/Wednesday: Test with 15 Veterans  Thursday: Synthesize friction points  Friday: Engineering updates the code before the next sprint begins
Outcome: A Platform Built for User Experience. This level of research means the iVXP will be driven by actual Veteran needs rather than vendor capabilities. It allows us to serve the aging Veteran in rural Ohio seeking Community Care options just as effectively as the Veteran transitioning from service who wants to build new vocational skills in Texas.

Migration & Technical Continuity
An AI-Driven, Zero-Downtime Strategy
Moving to Adobe isn't just swapping platforms; it is an opportunity to clean house. The current site contains thousands of static pages and fragmented sub-sites. A manual lift and shift would simply move the clutter to a new home. Reingold will apply a phased approach to cleanse, structure, and migrate content. We will use AI automation to ensure that we are not just moving legacy data but actively modernizing it for the new platform.
The Safe Rollout Strategy: We avoid the risk of an overnight switch. instead, we launch the new environment alongside the legacy Drupal site. We progressively route traffic to the new pages section-by-section (starting with the "My VA" dashboard) until the old system is fully replaced. This guarantees continuity and allows us to fix issues before they impact the entire population. We progressively route traffic to the new Adobe pages section-by-section until the legacy system is fully subsumed and can be safely decommissioned. This guarantees technical continuity and allows for real-time user feedback during the transition.
The Implementation Roadmap: A Phased Evolution. To minimize operational risk while delivering immediate value, we execute the migration through a disciplined crawl-walk-run framework aligned with VA's technical readiness:
Crawl: Deliver high-impact improvements to VA.gov experience. The initial phase aims to deliver high-value improvements to the Veteran experience while minimizing operational risk. Key efforts include technical migration, enhancing site performance, improving content discoverability, and activating personalization for VA.gov. This phase prioritizes speed and accessibility. By focusing on the digital front door, VA can quickly improve how Veterans access information and build a strong foundation for future enhancements.
Walk: Expanded engagement through owned channels. Once the experience layer is optimized, iVXP moves into proactive engagement. This phase helps the VA communicate more effectively with Veterans through marketing channels, building personalization continuity beyond the website.
Run: Advanced service integration through collaboration. This phase facilitates enhanced service integration through collaboration with VA agencies. By leveraging established experience, engagement, and data layers, iVXP can enable direct connection to services such as claims assistance, scheduling, telehealth, and other virtual support. Implementation of this phase occurs only after organizational readiness is confirmed, helping VA minimize unnecessary complexity and position the platform for sustained modernization.

Future-Proofing: Modernization is a continuous discipline, not a one-time deployment. We propose dedicating 5-10% of resources to an emerging tech pilot program. This operational sandbox allows VA to test high-potential capabilities--such as AI assistants, blockchain-verified service credentials, and wearable health integration--with small Veteran cohorts before enterprise rollout. This ensures iVXP remains a living platform, evolving alongside commercial technology rather than stagnating as a static IT project.
We have significant experience with large-scale federal government website transformation. What follows are strategies we use for the smoothest possible experience.

The AI-Assisted Content Ingestion Pipeline. We do not rely on manual copy-and-paste. We deploy an automated content ingestion engine trained on VA-specific taxonomies.
 Semantic Restructuring: Our AI agents don't just tag content; they analyze intent. For example, the system identifies that a Veteran looking for "proof of service" actually needs a DD214. Instead of migrating a generic PDF library, it automatically surfaces that specific form. The result is a platform that launches with clear, actionable answers, not just reorganized text.
 Identifying Outdated Info: The engine scans for "Redundant, Obsolete, or Trivial" (ROT) content-- such as policy memos from 2018 that are no longer valid. It flags them for archival, so the new site launches with a clean, accurate database.
Preserving Trust: Veterans rely on bookmarks and forum links to navigate the bureaucracy. If a link to a PACT Act application returns a 404 error, it feels like the government doesn't care.
 Smart Redirects: We implement an identity-preserving redirect layer. Every legacy URL maps to its new destination.
 Intelligent Redirection Logic: If a Veteran clicks a link to a closed program, they don't see an error code. We implement semantic redirect logic that detects the user's intended destination based on the broken URL structure and routes them to the current equivalent service page.
Headless Architecture: One Source of Truth. Currently, some VA mobile applications and VA.gov are out of sync and require separate updates. We implement a Headless CMS strategy that decouples the content from the display.
 Omnichannel Synchronization: When an approved VA employee updates a disability benefit rating in Adobe Experience Manager, that change is instantly pushed via API to the VA Mobile App, Kiosks, and the website simultaneously.
 Expansion Ability: This decoupled architecture allows the VA to spin up new frontend channels-- such as Voice Assistants or Smart Watch notifications--without rebuilding the backend content repository.
Empowering Public Affairs Officers (PAOs). Moving to Adobe changes the workflow for VA's content creators. It lets them focus on messaging, not coding.
 Low-Code/No-Code Empowerment: We move VA staff away from rigid, developer-dependent templates. Adobe's drag-and-drop interface allows approved non-technical staff to assemble "Experience Pages" using pre-certified, accessible components.
 Built-In Accessibility Checks: We implement automated 508 Compliance Checkers directly in the workflow. A creator cannot hit "Publish" if an image is missing Alt-Text or the contrast is too low. This keeps the site compliant by design, not by audit.
Change Management & User Adoption Campaign
Navigating Transformation for Sustainable Modernization
We recognize that in an organization as complex as VA, rapid change creates friction. New tools, no matter how good, can feel like just one more thing to learn for a busy employee. Our role is to stand beside VA leadership, staff, and Veterans, providing the practical support needed to move from hesitation to ownership.
We are deeply qualified to help VA navigate this change. From managing the internal cultural shift of VA Pulse to driving the external engagement of MakeTheConnection.net and the national telehealth rollout, Reingold is the only partner who has successfully navigated change on both sides of the VA firewall. We help VA stakeholders understand that the move to the Intelligent Veteran Experience Platform (iVXP) is not just a technical upgrade, but an ecosystem that empowers them to serve Veterans better.
Internal Adoption: Lessons from VA Pulse Moving from Drupal to Adobe represents a significant shift for Public Affairs Officers (PAOs) and content creators. We apply the specific lessons learned from our successful rollout of VA Pulse--where we helped thousands of VA employees break down silos and adopt new digital collaboration habits.

 Respecting the Workflow: Shifting away from established tools is hard. We bridge this gap by focusing on utility, not theory. We show a PAO exactly how the new Adobe tools will save them time from manual coding. We change the anxiety of a new system into the relief of a lighter workload.
 Practical Training: Our in-house instructional design team provides role-based training that shifts staff focus from maintaining code to designing experiences. We help VA staff see themselves as modern digital strategists, using the platform to improve their communications with their audiences.
 Demonstrating Impact to Congress: Leveraging our experience briefing Congressional stakeholders on advertising efficacy, we equip VA leadership with real-time ROI dashboards. You will be able to show internal stakeholders and oversight committees exactly how the new platform is reducing costs and improving Veteran satisfaction, validating the difficult decisions made during the transition.
External Adoption: Meeting Veterans Where They Are. Building a world-class platform is only half the battle; Veterans must trust it enough to use it. Our research shows that many Veterans have given up on the site, relying instead on VSOs or Reddit. We will launch a campaign focused on utility, not just branding. We don't just tell Veterans a new experience awaits them. We show them it can solve their navigation and access issues in minutes.
Precision Outreach Strategy. To drive adoption, VA must counter private-sector demand-capture tactics using the same capabilities used by commercial competitors. We propose a digital engagement strategy powered by data interoperability, moving beyond one-size-fits-all ads to execute high-precision advertising across the digital ecosystem:
 Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI): Using layered targeting, we will deploy advertisements across online environments Veterans frequently visit. Rather than passive banners, this technology inserts relevant content directly into the user experience, such as in-game updates or livestream overlays, capturing Veterans in active digital environments where traditional government outreach rarely penetrates.
 Decentralized Validation: We will partner with verified Veteran creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch to produce easy-to-understand platform demonstrations. These creators will record live walkthroughs of the new authentication and web experience, generating verifiable social proof, countering skepticism with raw video evidence of platform performance.
 Audience Targeting and Suppression: Using the Unified Veteran Profile, we not only can precisely reach Veterans in need of service but also can apply audience exclusion to the media buy. The system automatically suppresses ads for Veterans who have already completed a specific action (e.g., filing a claim). This operational safeguard directs budget only toward unconverted users, preventing wasted spend on Veterans who have already engaged.
Countering Patient Leakage. The VA MISSION Act created a marketplace where private facilities currently use aggressive lead generation to divert Veterans searching for care into higher cost, often unvetted options. To stop this financial bleed, we deploy a defensive SEO & AI optimization strategy that ensure VA.gov secures the top positions in search results and structures content for Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT). By establishing VA.gov as the definitive digital authority, we intercept these queries before marketers can, keeping Veterans within the cost-controlled VHA network and supporting the objective of taxpayer dollars funding VA care, not private sector referral fees.
Activating Trusted Messengers & Giving VSOs the First Look. Our research confirms that service organizations (like the VFW, DAV, and The American Legion) are often the first place Veterans turn for help with complex claims. We view these advocates as essential partners in building trust.
 Early Access: We give Service Officers early access to the new dashboard before launch.  Train the Trusted: We equip them with simple digital toolkits so they can walk Veterans through the
new system. When a Service Officer understands and trusts the platform, the Veterans they serve will too.
Why Reingold?: Commercial Innovation, Deployed at Scale. Modernization typically demands a tradeoff: the rigid infrastructure of systems integrators or the unproven flash of boutique design firms. Reingold eliminates this compromise. We fuse 15 years of VA operational certainty with private sector agility. We infuse the VA ecosystem with commercial-grade strategies honed across our diverse portfolio--including high-stakes innovations for major healthcare systems, the Census Bureau, the State Department, and the Department of War. This allows us to deliver outside-in disruption with the execution rigor of a partner who already knows the terrain.

Risks & Mitigations
Managing the Transition to a Commercial Enterprise Platform
Moving from open-source Drupal to a commercial enterprise platform (Adobe) transforms the Veteran experience, but it introduces distinct risks. We acknowledge those risks, and we have structured our approach to manage them before they impact the mission.
Risk: Operational Strain & The Cost of Inaction. Digital friction is not a neutral inconvenience; it creates measurable downstream impact. When Veterans abandon sessions due to confusing navigation, demand shifts to high-cost channels like contact centers, increasing workload for constrained staff. Furthermore, information gaps drive Veterans toward unvetted commercial providers, introducing inequity and misinformation that weakens benefit uptake and invites scrutiny.
 Our Mitigation: Deflecting Demand via Intent-Driven Resolution. iVXP stops this downstream bleed by resolving high-volume inquiries at the digital front door. Our AI-assisted benefits navigation and zero-navigation dashboards satisfy complex queries instantly, preventing the shift to expensive contact centers. Simultaneously, our defensive SEO strategy ensures VA.gov captures search intent first, keeping Veterans within the trusted VA ecosystem and reducing rework for VBA/VHA staff.
Risk: Vendor Lock-In & Data Portability. Moving from open-source Drupal to proprietary Adobe could create a dependency that makes future migration difficult.
 Our Mitigation: The Decoupled Headless Architecture. We implement Adobe not as a closed ecosystem, but as a Headless CMS delivering content via open-standard APIs (JSON/GraphQL). This ensures that while Adobe manages the experience, VA's data remains structure-agnostic and portable. We own the architecture; VA owns the data. Furthermore, we offset licensing costs by eliminating the technical debt tax (the thousands of labor hours currently spent patching custom Drupal modules) shifting budget from maintenance to innovation. We move VA away from the hidden costs of open source, where initial license savings are eclipsed by the high labor burden of security patching and module governance. By shifting to a commercial Adobe platform as a service (PaaS), VA eliminates the need for a standing army of developers just to keep the lights on, allowing those resources to be redeployed to feature development.
Risk: Authorization Delays. Waiting for a full FedRAMP Moderate authorization could delay launch by 1218 months.
 Our Mitigation: Parallel Agency-Sponsored ATO. We do not wait for sequential approvals. Instead, we pursue an Agency-Sponsored Authority to Operate (ATO) to clear compliance hurdles in parallel with development. We are ready to share the risk to deliver speed, ensuring deployment moves at the pace of innovation rather than the pace of bureaucracy.
Risk: Service Disruption & Change Fatigue. Veterans in our research explicitly stated that "constant changes were a pain." An overnight cutover risks confusing users and eroding trust.
 Our Mitigation: The Parallel Run Rollout & Dual-Stack Operations. We avoid the simultaneous switchover approach. We will run the new iVXP environment in parallel with the legacy site. Traffic will be routed to the new experience progressively, starting with high-impact/low-risk journeys (e.g., the "My VA" Dashboard). This allows us to validate the new lite mode performance for rural Veterans in real-time. If friction occurs, we can rollback traffic instantly without taking the site offline.
Risk: Workforce Skill Gaps. VA content creators are trained on Drupal; shifting to Adobe requires re-skilling thousands of employees.
 Our Mitigation: The VA Pulse Model. Leveraging our success with the VA Pulse rollout and our current telehealth program implementations, we treat training as an internal marketing campaign. We deploy a train-the-trainer model, certifying super users within each administration (VHA, VBA, NCA) to support their peers. We reduce the learning curve by configuring Adobe's interface to mimic familiar workflows, using guardrails that prevent users from breaking design standards, thus reducing anxiety and support tickets.

Risk: Privacy & Intrusive Personalization. Aggregating data from VistA and VBMS to predict Veteran needs could be perceived as intrusive if not handled with transparency.
 Mitigation: The Transparency Dashboard. We implement a Privacy by Design user interface. Veterans are given a Data Control Center where they can see exactly what data is being used to personalize their experience and can toggle settings (e.g., "Use my claim history to suggest benefits"). By giving the Veteran control, we transform "surveillance" into "service," building the trust required for long-term adoption.
Case Study
Enterprise Content Unification for a Global Children's Research Hospital
The Challenge: Fragmented Care Journeys. Like VA, this leading research hospital serves distinct audiences with vastly different needs: families in medical crisis, clinicians seeking protocols, and global researchers sharing data. Their digital ecosystem was fragmented across disjointed sub-sites (e.g., patient resources vs. clinical treatment vs. global alliances), forcing users to navigate organizational silos to find lifesaving information. The Solution: A Unified Digital Front Door. Reingold partnered with the institution to transform a static library of medical content into an intelligent support system. AI-Assisted Content Migration: We used custom AI agents to audit and tag over 2,000 pages of complex medical content. This allowed us to restructure the Information Architecture (IA) based on the user's journey (e.g., "Newly Diagnosed') rather than the hospital's internal departments. Adobe Ecosystem Implementation: We architected a unified platform using Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics. This enabled create-once-publish-everywhere capabilities, so that a change in a clinical protocol updated instantly across the website, mobile app, and patient kiosks. Personalized Outreach: We integrated the web experience with their CRM (ActiveCampaign) to deliver tailored communication flows. Families received resources specific to their child's diagnosis, while clinicians received updates on relevant trials--eliminating information overload. The Results: By transitioning from a static, fragmented web presence to an intelligent, unified platform, we delivered the following measurable outcomes:
 Unified Experience: Successfully consolidated disparately branded portals into a cohesive, branded digital ecosystem.
 Global Reach: Launched seamless multilingual experiences to support international patient families.  Engagement Growth: A data-driven content strategy drove a 3,000% increase in social engagement
for the patient resource program over 12 months, proving that personalized, relevant content builds trust.
Procurement Strategy Recommendation. Modernizing VA.gov requires the rigor of commercial FinTech and HealthTech sectors. However, strict commercial NDAs often prevent vendors from providing detailed references or CPARS equivalents for their most relevant private-sector work. To verify this protected expertise, we recommend prioritizing demonstrated technical capacity over standard past performance. VA may consider using interactive product demonstrations to validate architecture in real-time and heavily weight key personnel interviews. This would allow VA to evaluate the team's actual capability, even when specific commercial project details are shielded by privacy agreements.

APPENDIX B: USER JOURNEYS
Evolving VA.gov to Better Support Veterans and Those Who Serve Them VA.gov serves as a central entry point to a wide range of benefits, health care, and services across a complex and highly regulated environment. As the platform has grown to support many programs and audiences, users often need to invest time and effort to locate relevant information, interpret eligibility requirements, and determine appropriate next steps. Veterans, caregivers, and health care providers may arrive with clear needs but must translate those needs into VA structures in order to move forward. At the same time, expectations for digital services have evolved. Modern platforms are increasingly expected to recognize user intent, adapt to context, and guide users toward outcomes rather than relying solely on self- navigation. Within VA, achieving this requires balancing usability improvements with continuity of service, accessibility, security, and trust. The future-state flows presented here illustrate an approach that shifts more of the cognitive and navigational burden from the user to the platform itself. Rather than requiring users to understand VA programs upfront, the experience prioritizes early intent recognition, progressive guidance, and clear decision points supported by plain- language explanations and reassurance. Information is surfaced when it is most relevant, without overwhelming users or disrupting existing systems of record. Importantly, this approach represents an evolution of VA.gov rather than a disruption. The underlying services and content remain authoritative; the experience layer becomes more adaptive in how it sequences, contextualizes, and connects users to those services. The following user flows demonstrate how this model can support different scenarios-- from urgent needs to exploratory research and professional care coordination-- while maintaining clarity, trust, and continuity. The pages that follow offer three example user flows.

APPENDIX D: CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION AND A/B/N TESTING
Case Study: 2020 Census Integrated Communications Campaign
The Challenge. The 2020 Census was the first decennial count designed to be completed primarily online. The stakes were high: every percentage point increase in online self-response saved the government millions in printing, mailing, and door-to-door canvassing costs. To maximize these conversions across a diverse population of 330 million residents, Reingold needed a strategy to aggressively optimize the user experience (UX) in real-time.
The Solution: An Agile, Data-Driven Testing Framework Reingold implemented a rigorous testing process across the 2020Census.gov domain and paid media channels. Leveraging tools like Adobe Target and Adobe Analytics, we moved beyond assumptions, using live user data to dictate design and content decisions.
Iterative Web Optimization: We conducted 26 distinct optimization tests in less than six months. These were hypothesis-driven A/B/n tests focusing on high-impact elements such as call-to-action (CTA) button colors, text variations, and navigation placement.
Geotargeted Personalization: Recognizing that motivation varies by location, we implemented geotargeted user interface updates. By analyzing real-time response rates, we introduced location-based messaging specifically designed to convert users in regions with historically low participation.
Creative Asset Refinement: Our digital advertising team began with a small batch of assets and used online creative testing to refine them. Through continuous iteration, we optimized the "Shape Your Future" messaging platform, ensuring the creative resonated with specific audience mindsets before scaling the media buy.
Results: This data-first approach yielded significant efficiencies and performance gains:  High Success Rate: Our A/B/n tests achieved a win rate of 82%.  Tangible Conversion Lifts: Each winning test delivered a confident conversion lift of 2%-3%.  Massive Scale: These optimizations helped drive 49 million visitors from the website directly to the Internet Self-Response instrument--the most cost-effective method of data collection.

APPENDIX E: CONTENT TESTING
Designing Veteran-Centered Digital Experiences Through Evidence and Optimization
Designing for Veterans requires understanding how they see themselves--and validating that understanding through data. For more than a decade, we have treated messaging, imagery, and experience design not as static choices, but as hypotheses to be tested. This approach ensures every digital touchpoint is authentic, credible, and grounded in lived experience rather than assumption.
Putting Optimization into Practice: Mental Health Month Our approach is defined by a rigorous "test, learn, scale" methodology. Our annual Mental Health Month campaign illustrates this continuous improvement model. Drawing on evergreen testing and historical data, we implemented a wide range of optimizations across the entire campaign ecosystem. Three key examples demonstrate how specific insights translated into performance gains:
 Example 1: Enhancing the User Journey (UX) To prevent users from bouncing off static splash pages, we tested a new structure: a multi-page experience featuring an interactive hero section. By allowing users to immediately self-select topics of interest via anchor links to content lower on the homepage, we reduced cognitive load and achieved a 277% increase in multi-page visits.
 Example 2: Visual & Messaging Calibration We applied learnings from our ongoing evergreen testing, which showed that
banner ads with borders outperformed borderless designs and that specific action verbs drove higher intent. By adding high-contrast borders and switching the CTA from "Learn More" to an inviting "Explore," we saw a 42% increase in Click-Through Rate (CTR).
 Example 3: Data-Driven Content Mix Analytics from the prior year indicated that compilation-style videos drove website traffic more efficiently than videos featuring one Veteran. Acting on this data, we optimized our asset mix, shifting focus from single stories to six compilation videos. This strategic pivot contributed to an 85% increase in video views.
Mental Health Month: Year-Over-Year Results We have found that Veterans engage more deeply when they see themselves reflected in content. That recognition builds trust and reduces friction--but it must also drive action. Continuous optimization allows us to distinguish short-term attention from meaningful engagement and task completion. As a direct result of the strategic changes listed above, the Mental Health Month campaign saw significant growth in key performance indicators compared to the previous year:
 151% increase in site visits  108% increase in resource usage  211% increase in informational downloads
