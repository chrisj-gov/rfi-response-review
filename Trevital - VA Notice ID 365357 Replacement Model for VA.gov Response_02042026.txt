Role of Drupal in User Journeys - Drupal will function as the system of engagement for VA.gov, responsible for:
· Orchestrating user-facing workflows and states (signed out, partially authenticated, fully authenticated).
· Delivering personalized, contextual content based on user status, eligibility, and task. · Managing navigation, messaging, and recovery guidance consistently across the site. · Integrating securely with VA identity providers, authentication services, and downstream
systems through APIs. This architecture allows VA to evolve user journeys independently of backend systems while maintaining security, performance, and governance. Identity Proofing - Drupal will support identity proofing journeys by guiding users through clear, step-by-step experiences while integrating with VA-approved identity proofing services. Drupal will:
· Present identity proofing content and instructions using structured, reusable content models.
· Dynamically adjust messaging based on proofing status, errors, or interruptions returned from identity services.
· Preserve user context across redirects to third-party or shared identity providers. · Surface contextual help, FAQs, and escalation options without breaking the flow. · Log journey events and drop-off points for analytics and continuous improvement. This approach ensures identity proofing is understandable and Veteran-centered, while allowing identity services to evolve independently.
Sign-In - Drupal will enable a unified sign-in experience across VA.gov by acting as the consistent front-end layer for authentication flows. Drupal will:
· Detect authentication state and tailor page content, calls to action, and navigation accordingly.
· Support single sign-on patterns by coordinating sign-in and session state across VA services.
· Integrate sign-in entry points directly into task flows, reducing unnecessary interruptions. · Provide clear feedback during session timeouts and re-authentication events. · Maintain consistent sign-in language, design patterns, and error handling across
experiences. By centralizing experience logic in Drupal, VA can ensure predictable, secure sign-in journeys across the ecosystem. Account Recovery - Drupal will manage account recovery journeys by providing structured guidance and recovery pathways while securely integrating with authentication and identity systems. Drupal will:
· Deliver clear, sequential recovery instructions tailored to the user's situation. · Dynamically display available recovery options and next steps. · Prevent dead ends by offering alternate recovery paths and support escalation. · Retain user context and return users to their original task whenever possible. · Support accessibility and plain-language requirements across all recovery content.

These workflows will be tested across common and edge-case scenarios to ensure resilience and trust. Navigation - Drupal will provide the foundation for task-oriented, adaptive navigation across VA.gov. Drupal will:
· Power global, local, and contextual navigation using structured AI augmented taxonomies and content relationships.
· Adapt navigation and wayfinding based on authentication state and service eligibility. · Support personalized dashboards and "next best action" guidance for signed-in users. · Enable consistent breadcrumbs, progress indicators, and return paths. · Ensure navigation remains accessible, responsive, and consistent across devices. Navigation structures will be continuously informed by analytics and user research to align with real Veteran mental models. Governance, Scalability, and Continuous Improvement - Drupal's enterprise CMS capabilities will enable: · Centralized governance of journey content, messaging, and navigation patterns. · Modular workflow components that can be reused across benefits, healthcare, and
services. · Rapid iteration based on analytics, A/B testing, and usability findings. · Long-term scalability without re-platforming as VA services and identity systems evolve. · Hosted and maintained on Acquia's FedRAMP Moderate platform as a service

Known limitations, risks, and tradeoffs.
Drupal and Acquia provide a highly extensible, federated platform well-suited to VA's diverse benefit portfolios, but this flexibility requires strong governance to avoid over-customization, inconsistent content models, and operational complexity--particularly in a multi-site environment. Integration with legacy VA systems may require adapters or asynchronous patterns where APIs are immature, and incremental migration alongside existing VA.gov capabilities adds transitional complexity. Similarly, agentic AI capabilities depend on data quality and must be carefully scoped to maintain trust, transparency, and effective human handoffs. These AI components are designed to guide and assist Veterans--not make authoritative determinations-- trading strict determinism for improved personalization, navigation, and efficiency.
Lessons learned from past deployments.
Acquia's platform is purpose built to handle and support traffic spikes with their elastic infrastructure and has demonstrated the ability to do so with some of the highest trafficked events in recent history including the publication of the Epstein Files, Mueller Report, and live-streaming of the Olympic Games. That being said, foresight into expected high traffic events is always a positive. Proactively planning for peaks of user interaction helps ensure connected experiences that don't flinch even with staggering volume.

implementation. Additionally, we have developed plugins for CKEditor5 to provide custom functionality around styling, accessibility, linking, object embedding and inserting media to further enhance the content editing experience and provide added capabilities to content teams. Our team established rolebased access and permissions through the Drupal console to support content contributors, defines permissions and checks users as they access the sites along with other methods such as routes, entities, and forms. Our team manages the roles and permissions for the content contributors, with each role will only allow access to approved sections and sub-sections. Content Strategy: Our team reviewed the original structural design of the shared information environments of the websites to establish the sitemap of the content contained with the sites and establish the architecture. Throughout the process we define the hierarchical design to include the structuring of content, data, and interactions - we are able to modify the content based on the outcomes and modified the content accordingly. Development and Accessibility: Our team used a containerized solution based on Docker (ex Lando and Docksal) for our local development. When combined with Acquia CLI, this allows our developers to quickly spin up environments, services (such as SOLR), automate build steps, and integrate/sync with Acquia environments. It also eliminates the need to spend time configuring Docker and ensures our developers can easily maintain a local environment that mirrors the server environment, regardless of local operating system. We developed custom tooling around Lando to aid in developer workflows and server actions. Drupal Environment Administrator Support: Trevital ensured a secure, high-performing, and scalable Drupal environment, implement robust caching mechanisms such as Varnish and Redis to enhance performance, alongside SSL and firewalls for security. Regular security updates and compliance checks, including GDPR and HIPAA, was enforced to maintain data integrity. Efficient core, module, and user management was achieved using Git for version control, with updates managed via Composer. Enforcing role-based access control and integrating SSO solutions like Simple SAML (mini-orange) OAuth enhanced authentication security, while audit logs and admin activity monitoring improve accountability. A strong backup and disaster recovery plan included automated daily backups, failover strategies, and regular recovery testing. Performance optimization was driven by monitoring tools such as New Relic, database tuning, and load testing, while CI/CD pipelines enable automated deployments. For scalability and ongoing support, high-availability setups with Kubernetes were considered, along with thorough documentation, user and technical training, and a structured Jira ticketing system for issue resolution. Operations: Monitoring: Trevital maintained 24/7/365 system availability with total unplanned system downtime of less than 10 minutes per month. Trevital achieved 100 percent availability of the websites, exceeded all the defined BPA Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The team achieves this high level of availability by 1) managing administration activities that include issue identification, tracking, analysis, and resolution; 2) code generation, testing, and documentation; 3) change incorporation, maintenance of code, specialized configurations, customizations, and process automation such as scripts, templates, and workflows; 4) performance tuning and monitoring; 5) service application and system administration; and 6) managing user and group permissions. These applications use a heterogenous technology stack which includes Solr, Drupal (including Drupal Publishing) and MySQL Server databases. ARS security controls, WAF, cloud environment, containerization, OWASP: We conduct regular security scans of our Remote Administration (RA) environments, monitoring security advisories from Drupal.org for critical updates, which are promptly tested and applied as hotfixes. Access is controlled via SSO, with additional authentication mechanisms securing an "Edit" domain for developers and testers. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented using Simple SAML and the miniOrange Drupal module, adhering to NIST 800-53a standards. The Akamai Edge Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects against threats like DDoS, SQL injections, and XSS. Trevital is alerted to security issues

Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR)

Description of the Work Experience Similar to DOT WA3: Trevital is responsible to Migrate ASPR.gov from

SharePoint built on ASP.net into a new Drupal Content Management System instance utilizing Drupal 11 in the

Acquia FedRAMP managed cloud environment built by our team. Analyzed needs for licensing and tools by

conducting a thorough analysis of the client's requirements to recommend appropriate licensing and tools within

the Acquia ecosystem, ensuring cost-effective solutions that met scalability and performance needs. Developing a

custom content editing solution within Drupal that allows content creators to create dynamic layouts and content-

rich pages using a component library and the Drupal Layout Application Programming Interface (API). This

ensures consistency and responsiveness across the site and allows content creators to build dynamic pages

independently of the development team using an intuitive drag and drop interface. Additionally, we developed

plugins for CKEditor5 to provide custom functionality around styling, accessibility, linking, object embedding and

inserting media to further enhance the content editing experience and provide added capabilities to content teams.

Our team establish role-based access and permissions through the Drupal console to support content contributors,

define permissions and checks users as they access the sites along with other methods such as routes, entities, and

forms. We configured the hosting, development, testing, staging, and production environments to support Drupal

development and configuration management best practices as well as register the ASPR.gov domain provided by

the customer for the environment.

Project Management: Trevital's Project Manager leads the scrum team using an Agile methodology, managing

Jira tickets (Kanban board) and Confluence for XLC project documentation. The manager acts as the daily liaison

with the customer and stakeholders. Our approach integrates the CMS XLC with Agile/Scrum to meet

Medicaid.gov SOO requirements, prioritizing and developing solutions through the Agile process, with releases

approved by the COR and stakeholders. We include TLC requirements in each Sprint and deliver results for gate

reviews by the Technical Review Board (TRB). All artifacts adhere to the TLC life cycle and are submitted on time

in Confluence.

Strategic Planning and Governance Support: To maintain efficient operations, reduce risks, ensure compliance,

and drive innovation, Trevital first understands the business objectives. Then we establish a Web Governance

Framework that includes comprehensive documentation, policy development, and structured decision-making

processes, next we created a Medicaid Web Governance Charter that defines roles, responsibilities, and content

management policies for the Drupal-based CMS and any future platforms. Additionally, we facilitate monthly

governance meetings to review web infrastructure performance, compliance updates, and user experience

enhancement. We support the development of roadmaps, policies, and performance metrics that guide

implementation and long-term sustainability, ensuring that technology investments deliver measurable value and

adhere to compliance, security, and best practice standards.

Operations and maintenance of Drupal Environment: Trevital set up a Drupal environment in Acquia, we

began by provisioning a new application within the Acquia Cloud platform. Once created, we can use Acquia's

Cloud IDE or connect via Git to manage our Drupal codebase. The environment includes separate Dev, Stage, Test, and Prod instances, each with its own database and file system. We deploy Drupal by pushing code to the appropriate branch, importing a site database (if needed), and syncing files using Acquia's command-line tools (like BLT or Acquia CLI). Configuration management is handled through Drupal's config export/import system, and Acquia provides tools for performance, security, and access control throughout the process. Help Desk support and Automated Tracking Tool Support: Trevital provides users with timely assistance for technical issues, content updates, and platform-related questions through our dedicated support team. It ensures smooth day-to-day operations by resolving incidents, managing service requests, and offering guidance on best practices. Automated Tracking Tool Support complements this by implementing and maintaining Jira that monitor tickets, track performance metrics, and streamline workflow management. This tool enhances visibility, accountability, and response times, ensuring efficient and consistent support delivery. User Research and UX Design: Our team engages with stakeholders and external users to understand expectations, navigation preferences, and usability needs. User-centered design (UCD) ensures a better experience by identifying who will use the product, how, and why, while incorporating continuous user feedback. We prioritize intuitive navigation and content discovery based on user personas. Using MAZE software, we validate hypotheses through low- and high-fidelity prototypes to track user journeys. Our UX team works with engineers, SMEs, and business users to integrate UCD principles, ensuring usability, accessibility, simplicity, and consistency across tools and devices. Trevital aligns with USWDS design principles for an optimal user experience. Website Design, Redesign, and Migration Projects and New Websites on Platform: This involved creating a digital experiences to meet user needs and organizational objectives. This includes user research and usability testing to enhance the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design, content strategy, and accessibility compliance. Redesign and migration efforts focus on updating legacy systems, improving performance, and seamlessly moving content to modern, scalable Drupal platform. The new website follows a structured process-- from discovery and wireframing to development and launch--this ensures responsive, secure, and user-centered solutions that align with branding and functional requirements. Content Management Environment: Trevital has developed a custom content editing solution within Drupal that allows content creators to create dynamic layouts and content-rich pages using a component library and the Drupal Layout API. This ensures consistency and responsiveness across the site and allows content creators to build dynamic pages independently of the development team using an intuitive drag and drop interface. This content editing solution can be applied in a traditional or headless Drupal implementation. Additionally, we have developed plugins for CKEditor5 to provide custom functionality around styling, accessibility, linking, object embedding and inserting media to further enhance the content editing experience and provide added capabilities to content teams. Content Strategy: All content development tasks follow an Agile approach and incorporate design thinking from inception through deployment. An existing backlog of epics and user stories (create new ones, as needed) are continuously created and reviewed along with CMS and other stakeholders to prioritize based on impact, scale, urgency, and other factors. Each selected group of user stories go through a sprint-based development, testing, and deployment process to push the enhancements into the production environment. We use Jira to maintain and update the backlog, epics, and user stories and Confluence to develop job aids, user guides and product roadmaps. Designing and configuring complex search solutions using the Search API: The Drupal Search API provides a framework for integration with various back-ends. On Medicaid.gov, Trevital has implemented the SOLR search platform to power Views, providing dynamic faceted search filters, the ability to search inside pdfs, fuzzy/full-text search, custom fields, and more. Through use of SOLR, site Views are more performant and scalable that databasepowered views. Dynamic facets allow users to drill down and refine search results by category or attributes, while filters are recalculated and displayed to reflect the narrowed categories. Search.gov: Trevital's approach to Search.gov integrates the federal search platform directly into Drupal websites, enabling a unified and accessible search experience. Our team implemented the Search.gov module, which allows site administrators to configure search settings and display results within the Drupal theme. The integration ensures compliance with federal standards, supports faceted search, and allows customization of search results pages to match site branding. It is a scalable, and user-friendly to deliver relevant content across government websites. Disaster Discovery: Acquia and Drupal environments involves a comprehensive strategy to ensure business continuity and data protection. Trevital works closely with Acquia who provides automated daily backups of code, databases, and files across all environments (Dev, Stage, Prod), with options for manual backups as needed.
