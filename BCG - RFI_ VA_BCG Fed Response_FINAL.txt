Modernizing VA.gov to be the World's Leading Digital Experience 1.1 Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges BCG partnered with companies to build from existing technologies and reinvent the holistic digital experience across their web, mobile, and other consumer touchpoints. This includes consumer leaders such as Starbucks, Allstate, L'Oreal, Home Depot, and Google. In health care, BCG has worked with 12 of the 20 top-ranked hospitals by U.S. News & World Report and 4 of the 5 major national-scale payers. BCG has been recognized as a Leader across major technology analyst reports, such as Forrester Wave and IDC MarketScape, for capabilities in digital transformation services, artificial intelligence, design, customer experience, business strategy.
Of particular relevance for VA, we have supported multiple leading US hospital systems, including those using Oracle Health EHR, to design and build industry-leading digital patient experiences. As part of this work, we solved for many of the common, complex issues: identity validation that increases both security and access, fault-tolerant patterns that improve performance patient data access via FHIR APIs and other systems, and robust health data normalization and harmonization that create efficiency across legacy data sources.
Globally, BCG has architected, developed, or deployed hundreds of AI builds in the past three years. BCG has also supported the AI strategy delivery for 5 of the top 10 largest technology companies. In healthcare, our AI work has supported transformations in clinical care, patient access, revenue cycle efficiency, call-center modernization, and operational transformation. We also practice what we preach, where BCG is one of OpenAI's largest enterprise customers and a top user of Custom GPT's globally. It is one of the many reasons why OpenAI selected BCG as one of only two deployment partners in the Federal market, and we are a Federal enablement partner for Anthropic.
We bring these same commercial capabilities, tools, tech partnerships, and people in our service to the US Federal government and the Department of Veterans Affairs. This leads to better outcomes, faster, at greater value to the government. We have served the VA Office of Information Technology across a number of mission-critical efforts, such as the My HealtheVet (MHV) modernization now in production in support of upcoming Oracle Health site launches. We understand the critical Veteran-facing services provided, as well as the underlying systems and architectures that underlie them, because we have been partnering with Office of the CTO to modernize them.
We have delivered world-class digital experiences for some of the largest, most complex organizations and understand how those experiences could help VA.gov realize its full potential within this Presidential Administration.

1.2 Our Perspective

Request for Information | Replacement Model for VA.gov Notice ID: 365357 February 04, 2026

VA.gov is the primary digital front door to the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is where Veterans and caregivers access healthcare, benefits, and services, and is a critical lifeline for those who made sacrifices for our nation. It is also a highly effective, convenient, and efficient method to help Veterans access the benefits they have earned, especially relative to alternatives such as call centers or in-person.

VA has been very resourceful in how it has built the existing site and mobile app. The VA Flagship mobile app has an admirable 4.8 rating in the Apple App store with 288K+ ratings. It enables many critical functions for Veterans across healthcare (medical record access, prescription request/renewal, physician messaging, etc.) as well as benefits (benefits application submission, VA loan guarantee, GI bill eligibility, etc.). Veterans benefit from the breadth of services offered on VA.gov now but, necessitated by budget realities, the underlying components were developed in siloes as individual task orders (sometimes splitting front end and back-end teams) and not always in a manner which allows for maximum synergy and efficacy across components. To serve the full set of Veteran needs, it must draw from many interconnected legacy systems in VA with varying levels of performance, which will take time to modernize.

But with the transition to Oracle Health as the enterprise EHR, the structural shift to Community Care Next Gen, and the rise of AI, there is shift in how software is made and delivered. VA has embraced a "buy before build" posture, looking to private sector, commercial tech to accelerate modernization and meet Veteran expectations. Under the leadership of Secretary Collins and acceleration of the Federal EHR, VA has a unique window to build from existing VA.gov assets and commercial partnerships to reinvent the Veteran experience. Decisions made at this moment create an opportunity to establish a durable, secure, and interoperable foundation - one that can lower long-term operating cost and enable VA to continuously evolve and reinvent the Veteran experience without repeated large-scale reinvestment.

We work with many US healthcare organizations who have successfully navigated similar transitions; the leading institutions demonstrate that value is not unlocked by the EHR alone. Value is unlocked when the organization is transformed tip-to-tail, where digital assets, data platforms, investment strategies and operating models are transformed to function across heterogeneous, modern delivery environments. Modernization of the MHV platform in the last 12 months demonstrates the architectural approach, driving expansion and refinement of MHV to ensure that the migration to Oracle Health enhances, rather than fragments, the Veteran experience. VA.gov is the natural extension to realize that value for Veterans.

1.3 Platform Architecture Grounded in Modularity and Continuity
A successful replacement for VA.gov must balance two imperatives that are often in tension: maintaining uninterrupted service for millions of Veterans while materially modernizing the underlying architecture. In our experience, this balance is achieved by setting a clear end-state vision and delivering it through an incremental replacement model that deliberately avoids "rip and replace" cutovers.

1.3.1 Data-first Foundation, API-First Delivery
The My HealtheVet (MHV) modernization provides a concrete example of this approach in practice. Rather than starting with surface-level experience changes, the work focused first on establishing a strong architectural foundation by integrating key data sources into a shared platform. This data-first strategy accelerated access to near-real-time information, improved data quality and completeness, and enabled interoperability across disparate systems. Crucially, it created the conditions for modular, API-first services to be layered on top--allowing new capabilities to scale while legacy systems remained safely encapsulated behind well-defined seams.
On top of that data foundation, the modernization established an API-first delivery layer. A unified API layer abstracted heterogeneous backends and provided stable contracts for Veteranfacing applications, reducing the amount of system-specific logic embedded in web and mobile experiences. Cloud-native, distributed services organized by data domain and functional capability enabled teams to deliver independently, scale elastically, and operate with greater resilience. Integration patterns spanned request-response, event-driven, and batch workflows, which allowed near-real-time experiences where required while also enabling asynchronous updates, reconciliation, and proactive notifications without tightly coupling the Veteran experience to any single backend system's latency or availability.
These patterns are not theoretical. As part of the MHV modernization, they were deployed to production to accelerate delivery of complex Veteran-facing capabilities, including access to medical records and medications. They also enabled rapid integration of new upstream systems such as Oracle Health and established a clear path to unifying health data across multiple EHRs and legacy source systems. In effect, this work transformed My HealtheVet from a VistA-only view in 2024 into an EHR-agnostic, high-performing platform by 2026--creating the technical foundation required to meet Secretary Collins's accelerated Oracle Health deployment schedule.
The same architectural principles should guide the rest of VA.gov. Organizing the platform around shared services as reusable building blocks, independently deployable and productowned with clear contracts, enables consistent experience patterns across health and benefits while eliminating duplicated logic, especially for identity, proxy access, navigation, search, and orchestration.
1.3.2 Building Blocks as an Accelerant to Leverage Private-Sector Innovation
At the core of this model is a unified data and API layer that shields Veteran-facing applications from upstream complexity. VA's system landscape is heterogeneous and evolving, encompassing VistA, Oracle Health, benefits platforms, community care integrations, and commercial software partners. Beyond the technical benefits, the modularity reinforces two strategic efforts underway:
· The ability for VA to embed "best of market" commercial tech innovation. VA is not be beholden to any single provider as technology evolves, new services become available, and new Veteran demands emerge - or beholden to custom development of similar concepts. For example, VA could quickly embed telehealth visits in the mobile app, integrating third-party consumer video directly to clinicians using the Oracle EHR. Similarly, the modular infrastructure could greater interoperability: with personalized PHRs and Veteran-generated health data, consistent with White House priorities and

CMS interoperability advancements, or rich datasets like Palantir National Center for Veterans Data Platform and/or Summit Data Platform to enabling personalized medicine and novel discovery pathways.
· The modular architecture is critical as Community Care continues to expand. Veterans increasingly receive care across VA and non-VA providers operating on diverse EHRs with varying latency and exchange mechanisms. VA.gov must be explicitly designed to bridge these contexts, presenting a coherent and personalized experience regardless of where care is delivered. The MHV modernization demonstrates how fine-grained, distributed services and event-driven pipelines can support this hybrid reality at scale, without duplicative custom logic at each integration point.
Adopting this model allows VA to modernize capabilities completely while executing incrementally. New experiences can be delivered by composing existing services, while legacy systems are progressively wrapped, normalized, and, where appropriate, retired. Critically, this avoids the cost and fragility associated with rebuilding bespoke logic across every layer of the stack--a pattern that has repeatedly driven overruns and long-term maintenance burden in large public-sector programs.
1.4 Personalization at Scale
The convergence of Oracle Health and Community Care creates an unprecedented opportunity for AI-enabled personalization at scale. Standardized clinical data from Oracle Health, combined with utilization and referral data from community providers, allows VA.gov to move beyond static information delivery toward context-aware, personalized Veteran journeys. Timely guidance, proactive reminders, and adaptive navigation can be triggered by real-world events across care settings, reducing friction for Veterans and unnecessary demand on staff.
Commercial healthcare organizations and digital platforms increasingly use AI to tailor navigation, messaging, and outreach based on individual context, improving engagement and outcomes while reducing unnecessary demand on call centers and staff. We have supported leading commercial payers to embed these same technologies to improve patient experience and reduce cost.
The opportunity for population health and personalization at VA is significant. As Veterans move fluidly between VA and non-VA care settings, analytics and AI-driven segmentation must extend beyond VA-only data to meaningfully influence outcomes. VA.gov should synthesize clinical, utilization, and behavioral signals across both contexts to inform outreach, navigation, and "next best action" guidance at both the population and individual level.
In this model, VA.gov becomes a two-way engagement platform: a low-cost, low-burden digital channel through which Veterans and caregivers receive timely reminders, nudges, and followups, and a new access point through which they can engage VA more proactively--such as reviewing care plans with AI-supported guidance or adjusting follow-up schedules without manual intervention.
Personalization should be grounded in clear, high-value use cases. VA already holds rich information about each Veteran--from service and benefits history to care utilization and clinical context--which can be used to simplify interactions, pre-populate information, surface relevant

options, and reduce cognitive load across complex journeys. Leading organizations consistently start with informational and navigational support, using AI to guide users to the right next step, and then expand capabilities over time as governance, confidence, and operational readiness mature.
1.5 AI Maturity and Guardrails
AI can materially reduce friction and improve the Veteran experience, but only if VA builds it on a trusted data foundation and implements explicit guardrails aligned to VA's Trustworthy AI Framework. For VA.gov, safety and accountability must be designed in from the start. AIinfluenced content and recommendations should be traceable to source data and policies, and every AI-mediated action should produce durable audit trails that reflect both the acting user and any delegation context. High-impact or ambiguous scenarios should route through human-in-theloop workflows with clear escalation paths. Models should be continuously monitored for drift, bias, and harmful output patterns. Finally, AI capabilities should be explicitly bounded to informational and navigational support by default. Expansion into more sensitive domains should only occur when VA has established the corresponding clinical governance, safety gates, and operational accountability structures.
In parallel, VA can use AI to accelerate delivery and improve platform operations without increasing Veteran-facing risk. These applications include automated test generation and regression detection, faster documentation and runbook creation, incident triage support through log summarization, and improved observability workflows. Done well, operational AI increases throughput and reliability while keeping delivery-critical paths under human oversight.
The technical foundation already exists within VA's data ecosystem, including enterprise data platforms capable of ingesting and harmonizing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. The National Design Studio resources and guidance can be leveraged to ensure consistency and best practices are used as customers experience the digital channels in new ways.
1.6 Operating Model Implications
Replacing VA.gov is as much an organizational transformation as a technical one. Even the most elegant architecture will fail to deliver value if operating models, incentives, and decision rights are not aligned. Commercial organizations that successfully modernize platforms consistently also invest in dedicated ownership, clear accountability, and feedback loops tied to user outcomes rather than output metrics.
Additionally, the shift to Oracle Health and expanded Community Care reinforces that VA.gov replacement is not a finite program but a long-lived platform evolution. As data access improves and care pathways diversify, demand for new digital capabilities will accelerate. Meeting that demand sustainably requires treating VA.gov as a product ecosystem, supported by reusable platform services, AI-enabled tooling, and lean cross-functional teams. Incentives must reward reuse of shared services and improved Veteran outcomes, rather than engineering effort. In our experience, organizations that address these elements upfront achieve higher end-user adoption, preserve their future tech optionality, and drive lower long-term cost.

1.7 Closing Perspective The replacement of VA.gov, the transition to Oracle Health, and the growth of Community Care together represent a structural inflection point. VA can meet the challenge with a re-invented approach to VA.gov as the connective tissue to translate these changes into a coherent, efficient Veteran-centric experience. By deliberately aligning VA.gov's data foundation and integration architecture, AI strategy, and operating model to operate across VA and non-VA care contexts--while preserving modularity, security, and continuity of service--VA can establish a digital front door that is not only modern, but durable. This approach positions VA to advance population health, personalization, and trust at national scale, ensuring that investments made today continue to deliver value as Veteran needs and care models evolve.
