Response to RFI

Figure 1 ExeQut LLCs Approach, Modernizing VA.gov Through Phased, Risk Reduced, Veteran Centered Delivery.

ExeQut LLC does not advocate abandoning legacy systems on day one. We execute multi-phase transitions that begin with discovery, analysis, and design across infrastructure, hardware, and core software. This phase establishes a clear understanding of existing architectures, dependencies, workflows, and constraints. Human factors, user experience, and business object models are assessed against legacy designs and then transitioned to modern, standards-based architectures.

This approach balances operational priorities, budgets, and technical debt. It enables VA to define a modernization roadmap that links new systems, models, and interfaces to real user needs and organizational goals. Phased transitions reduce downtime risk, limit disruption, and support continuous service delivery throughout modernization.

 User Journey and User Centered Design

ExeQut LLC places user centered design at the core of modernization. We address the full user journey from identity proofing and sign in through recovery, navigation, and task completion. Our process begins with user research through surveys, interviews, behavioural analytics, and persona development. This work captures the needs of Veterans, families, caregivers, and staff with diverse accessibility and service requirements.
