February 4, 2026 Allison Fulton and Evan Schlisserman U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Re: RFI - Replacement Model for VA.gov (Issued January 14, 2026)
League, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Department of Veterans Affairs' Request for Information regarding a replacement model for VA.gov. We are excited to participate in this effort and to support a more seamless, engaging digital experience that helps Veterans more easily find and access the care and benefits they need - especially when that need is time-sensitive, stressful, or urgent. Today, many authenticated digital experiences are reactive and place the burden on Veterans to sift through a large set of information, benefits, and programs - often resulting in call center escalation or abandonment. League enables VA's digital assets to be more proactive by embedding guided journeys, next best actions, orchestration, navigation, and secure AI Agent Teams within VA web and mobile experiences. We look forward to the possibility of follow-on discussions and are happy to provide sample workflows and reference architectures aligned to VA's priorities for secure, Veteran-centric navigation and self-service.
Sincerely,
Doug Tipsword Director, Sales League Inc. dtipsword@league.com | 847.363.5886

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A Seamless Veteran Navigation Experience through Embedded Web & Mobile Components
VA is evaluating options to replace VA.gov with a secure, Veteran-first digital front door that improves navigation across benefits, healthcare, services, and information while integrating with legacy and emerging VA systems.
Problem and opportunity: Authenticated self-service is often reactive and one-size-fits-all. Veterans facing time-sensitive health or life needs must search across complex information, benefits, and programs without personalized guidance, driving call-center escalation and task abandonment. League helps VA make the experience proactive and personalized by embedding guided journeys, next best actions, and secure AI support in both VA.gov and VA mobile.
League's role in a VA.gov replacement model
 Embedded engagement and navigation layer deployable within VA web and mobile experiences (no full site rebuild required).
 Personalized guided journeys and next best actions to help Veterans complete complex tasks and find the right care path.
 Secure AI Agent Teams for conversational self-service and support, with orchestration, guardrails, and escalation to humans when needed.
 Standards-based integration: SSO with VA-approved identity providers and APIs to downstream VA systems.
What League does not provide (and how we fit into a broader replacement model)
 Not a prime website builder / CMS replacement for VA.gov (information architecture, front-end rebuild, or content migration).
 Not a identity proofing / identity management provider; League integrates with VA-approved identity providers and authentication services.
Representative outcomes from enterprise healthcare deployments
 Manulife: +70% increase in mobile activations and 3x increase in monthly active users after embedding League capabilities.
 Highmark Health: 5x increase in program enrollment (e.g., mental health point solution) after deploying League engagement and navigation.

PROPOSED SOLUTION & APPROACH
An Engagement Layer to Orchestrate and Personalizes the Veteran Experience
A phased modernization path that maintains continuity of service  Start with high-impact Veteran journeys and navigation use cases (e.g., finding the right care, benefits questions, appointment preparation, program enrollment).  Embed League capabilities into existing VA.gov and/or VA mobile experiences to improve navigation and task completion without waiting for a full rebuild.  Expand incrementally across benefit portfolios with consistent design patterns, analytics, and governance.
Composable engagement layer above VA systems  League acts as an engagement/orchestration layer that connects to VA systems via APIs and supports multiple back-end sources of truth.  Journeys and AI agents can be configured to route Veterans to the right destination (self-service flows, VA applications, call center escalation, or in-person care).
Operating model considerations (where League helps and where partners typically lead)  League provides configurable engagement tools, analytics, and AI operations for ongoing iteration.  VA and/or a prime integrator typically owns site architecture, CMS/content operations, and enterprise identity strategy; League integrates to these layers.

SOLUTION DETAIL | EMBEDDED VETERAN JOURNEYS
Guided Journeys and Next Best Actions Across VA Digital Channels
Embedded, Personalized Veteran Journeys & Next Best Actions (NBA)
Guided, step-by-step workflows embedded directly into VA digital experiences.
 Deliver contextual "what should I do next?" experiences for complex, multi-step tasks (benefits, healthcare access, forms, follow-ups).
 Orchestrate across VA systems and point solutions so engagement feels seamless even when systems are not.
 Configurable journeys that can be updated quickly as policies, programs, and Veteran needs evolve-without large redevelopment cycles.
 Consistent patterns across web and mobile so Veterans have a familiar experience regardless of channel.
 Targeted prompts and reminders aligned to Veteran goals, eligibility, and prior behavior (with appropriate consent and privacy controls).
Measurement and Optimization
 Instrument journeys with events and funnels (task success, drop-off points, time-to-complete).  Measure outcomes like digital adoption, time-to-answer, CSAT, and deflection of avoidable
support contacts. Enable continuous improvement via iterative journey updates and controlled experimentation.

SOLUTION DETAIL | AI AGENT TEAMS
Secure AI Agent Teams answer questions, take actions, and escalate safely
Concierge + Orchestration Layer
A single, secure AI concierge acts as the front door, interpreting intent and routing to specialized task agents.
 One conversational interface for Veterans (consistent tone and experience).  Intent understanding routes requests to the right agent (e.g., benefits, care navigation) or to a
human support path.  Orchestration enforces privacy, safety guardrails, and minimal-data access for sub-agents.
Example Agent Teams for VA
 Benefits Navigation Agent Team: plain-language answers, eligibility guidance, task completion support (with citations to source content).
 Care Navigation Agent Team: help Veterans choose the right care option, prepare for appointments, and understand follow-up steps.
 Health Coach Agent Team (non-clinical): supportive engagement aligned to VA programs and education content.
 Care Gaps / Preventive Actions Agent Team: reminders and guided completion of preventive actions (as defined by VA).
Safety, Compliance, and Human-in-the-Loop
 Guardrails + retrieval-based answers to reduce hallucination risk; configured escalation to humans for complex issues.
 Clear boundaries between information and medical advice; non-clinical by design unless/ until explicitly scoped otherwise.
 Continuous evaluation and testing to monitor quality, safety, and reliability.
