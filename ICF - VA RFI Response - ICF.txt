Our Understanding of the VA.gov Replacement Challenge
VA.gov serves as the nation's primary digital front door for Veterans, their families, caregivers, and other stakeholders seeking access to healthcare, benefits, and services. Few federal digital platforms operate at this scale or with comparable emotional, cognitive, and operational stakes. Veterans often arrive with urgent needs, incomplete information, and little tolerance for friction, placing extraordinary demands on a single entry point to a highly complex enterprise.
Over the past decade, VA has made meaningful progress consolidating legacy portals, improving accessibility, and establishing VA.gov as a trusted destination for millions of users. These efforts represent a significant achievement given the size, regulatory constraints, and organizational diversity of the Department. VA.gov today is markedly better than the fragmented ecosystem it replaced.
Despite this progress, VA.gov still largely reflects an information-first web paradigm. Veterans are frequently required to read, interpret, and self-navigate extensive content to determine eligibility, identify next steps, and complete high-stakes tasks. This places the burden of understanding VA's structure, terminology, and processes on the Veteran, at precisely the moments when clarity and guidance matter most.
Modern digital experiences increasingly reverse this burden. Rather than expecting users to understand the system before acting, leading platforms guide users through tasks, anticipate needs, maintain context, and reduce decision fatigue at every step. For Veterans, whose interactions with VA.gov may be infrequent, time-sensitive, and emotionally charged, this distinction is particularly important. There is little room for trial-and-error or exploratory navigation when outcomes directly affect health, financial stability, or family well-being.
As a result, the next evolution of VA.gov is not primarily a question of visual redesign or incremental usability improvements. It represents a deeper shift in orientation: from a site that explains benefits to a platform that actively helps Veterans secure them. Achieving this shift requires thoughtful coordination across experience design, platform architecture, data, governance, and operating models--while maintaining continuity of service and operating within a highly regulated federal environment.
The opportunity ahead is to build on VA's consolidation and Veteran-centric foundation by introducing experiences that are more guided, personalized, and adaptive--meeting Veterans where they are and moving with them toward successful outcomes, without disrupting the services they rely on today.

A Vision for the Next VA.gov
ICF envisions the next generation of VA.gov as a digital platform that actively supports Veterans in accomplishing meaningful outcomes--rather than a destination that primarily delivers information. This vision builds on VA's substantial progress to date while recognizing that the scale, diversity, and complexity of VA services require a fundamentally different orientation for the future.
Rather than attempting a single, monolithic transformation, the next VA.gov can be shaped by a small set of clear, durable principles that guide both experience design and platform evolution over time. These principles reflect observed Veteran needs, proven patterns from large-scale digital platforms, and the operational realities of a highly regulated federal environment.
We propose four organizing pillars to guide this evolution:
· Simple: A task-centered, application-first experience that helps Veterans act with clarity and confidence · Personalized: Veteran-centric experiences organized around life events, goals, and known context · Agentic: Embedded conversational and assistive intelligence that helps Veterans navigate uncertainty and
complexity · Productized: A platform governed by modern product management principles to sustain progress at scale
Together, these pillars describe how Veterans experience VA.gov and how VA operates and evolves it. Each pillar addresses a distinct dimension of the challenge--clarity, relevance, guidance, and sustainability--while reinforcing the others. Progress in one area strengthens the effectiveness of the rest.
Importantly, these principles are not tied to a single technical implementation or delivery model. They are intended to support near-term improvements, mid-term platform evolution, and longer-term innovation without disrupting continuity of service. They allow VA to move forward incrementally, while maintaining a consistent direction as systems, policies, and technologies evolve.
PILLAR 1: SIMPLE
A TASK-CENTRIC, APPLICATION-FIRST EXPERIENCE
The next VA.gov should be a task-centered digital application that organizes the experience around what Veterans are trying to accomplish, rather than around pages of information or institutional navigation. An application-first experience feels less like browsing a website and more like entering a workspace where Veterans are immediately oriented to their active claims, benefits, and tasks, and where status and progress are more prominent than explanatory text.
In practice, this means Veterans are not repeatedly routed through instructional pages or asked to interpret where to go next. Instead, core actions such as filing a claim, checking status, or managing benefits are presented as cohesive workflows that maintain context as Veterans move through them. Progress is visible without scrolling, drafts persist across sessions, and Veterans can return to ongoing work without reorienting themselves or starting over. Navigation supports achieving goals, rather than requiring Veterans to retrace steps through menus or breadcrumbs to find where work actually happens.
By structuring VA.gov as task-oriented web interface, the platform absorbs procedural complexity that Veterans currently manage themselves. Veterans spend less time deciphering where they are or what to do next and more time moving toward resolution. This clarity of action and visibility of progress reduces frustration, builds confidence, and establishes the foundational simplicity required for effective personalization, assistive intelligence, and long-term platform evolution.
What might this feel like for Veterans? The design below presents VA.gov as a personal workspace where Veterans can see what needs attention, track progress, and continue active work in one place

PILAR 2: PERSONALIZED
VETERAN-CENTRIC & LIFE-EVENT ORIENTED
As Veterans move through different stages of their lives and relationships with VA, the relevance of benefits, information, and actions changes--and a next-generation VA.gov experience has an opportunity to reflect that progression more clearly. Rather than presenting every Veteran with the same breadth of content, the experience can increasingly adapt based on who the Veteran is, what they are likely eligible for, and where they are in their journey.
In practice, this approach would draw on known Veteran context-- such as service history, benefit enrollment, claims activity, and prior interactions--to organize the experience around life events and goals instead of VA program structures. Veterans would spend less time navigating broad benefit categories or reading extensive eligibility guidance to determine applicability, and more time engaging directly

ICF Experience Highlight
Context Modeling Veteran Needs ICF's decade-long stewardship of the Veterans Health Administration's Survey of Enrollees created the foundational, context-driven insights needed for a truly Veteran-centric, life-event-oriented VA.gov experience.
· Designed and executed one of VA's largest annual multimode surveys--collecting ~42,000 Veteran responses each year for 10+ years
· Demonstrated ICF's proven ability to build context-aware, data-driven models aligned to Veteran life events, service needs, and evolving eligibility
· Reduced the cognitive burden on Veterans by shifting relevance determination to the system-- mirroring the core vision of a life-event-based, adaptive VA.gov
· Provided empirically grounded insights enabling VA to organize content and actions around what matters most to Veterans at each stage of their journey

with benefits, actions, and next steps that are likely to matter to them. Informational content would continue to play an important role, but primarily as support once relevance has been established.
By shifting more of the relevance determination from the Veteran to the platform, VA.gov has an opportunity to reduce mental load, shorten time to action, and increase confidence that Veterans are seeing what applies to them.
What might this feel like for Veterans? The two mockups below demonstrate two design approaches that both show how veteran life events can be a guide for quickly accessing benefits.

PILLAR 3 -- AGENTIC

EMBEDDED CONVERSATIONAL & ASSISTIVE INTELLIGENCE

One of the most promising opportunities for a next-generation VA.gov is the assistance that helps Veterans navigate complexity, resolve uncertainty, and move forward when structure and personalization alone are insufficient. Rather than functioning as a separate help destination, this assistance would be integrated directly into the experience Veterans are already using.
In practice, this capability could be applied at moments of friction--when Veterans are unsure where to begin, confused by eligibility or requirements, encountering system changes, or navigating edge cases that fall outside standard flows. Through conversational interaction, Veterans could ask questions in plain language, receive explanations tailored to their context, and be guided directly to appropriate next actions. Assistance might point Veterans to the right place, explain why a step is required, or help them recover when progress stalls. When implemented thoughtfully, this form of assistive intelligence has the potential to reduce abandonment, lower support burden, and increase Veteran confidence during complex or unfamiliar tasks. Over time, it also creates a mechanism for VA.gov to adapt as systems, policies, and processes change--helping Veterans succeed without requiring them to relearn the platform each time the experience evolves.

PILLAR 4 -- PRODUCTIZED
GOVERNED BY PRODUCT MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES
To sustain the gains from a simpler, more personalized, and assistive VA.gov, the platform itself must be run as a portfolio of products with clear ownership, stable funding, and outcome-based decision making. This pillar shifts VA.gov from project cycles and page-level deliverables to durable product lines--each with accountable leaders, empowered teams, and a roadmap tied to Veteran outcomes rather than outputs.

Product lines with named owners and decision rights. Claims, healthcare enrollment, appointments, education benefits, and survivor journeys are treated as products with explicit accountability for end-to-end outcomes across VBA, VHA, and NCA touchpoints. Governance focuses on what moves Veteran outcomes, not just feature delivery.
Funding and planning modeled for products, not projects. Multi-year product funding enables continuous discovery and delivery, faster iteration, and fewer handoffs--replacing episodic "build and hand over" cycles. Shared services and data as platform products. Intake, status, notifications, document management, and eligibility signals become reusable capabilities that product teams can assemble to ship improvements quickly and consistently.
Analytics tied to outcomes. Measures emphasize Veteran time-to-benefit, successful resolution, and reduced effort, not page views or releases completed. Product reviews use these signals for prioritization.

ICF Experience Highlight
ICF's Product Forge: Product
Ownership for Government ICF's Product Forge shows how large-scale government platforms can move beyond page-based delivery to true product-line ownership--driving faster iteration, higher quality, and measurable outcomes.
· Embeds multidisciplinary teams around durable platform products, each with a named owner, stable funding, and an outcome-driven roadmap
· Enables continuous discovery, rapid iteration, and accountable decision-making across complex platform environments.

Approach Considerations
VA's request signals an interest in reimagining VA.gov but leaves open the scale, ambition, and degree of institutional change involved. In response, it is necessary to frame multiple approaches that represent distinct levels of effort, risk, and potential impact. Presenting graduated approaches allows VA to evaluate tradeoffs, align ambition with organizational readiness, and avoid conflating surface improvements with structural transformation. Each approach offers a different balance of speed, complexity, and Veteran benefit, enabling informed decision-making based on funding realities, governance appetite, policy constraints, and long-term strategic intent.

VA's request suggests interest in reimagining VA.gov but leaves the scope and level of institutional change undefined. In response, we outline multiple approaches that reflect different levels of effort, risk, and impact. This graduated framing helps VA assess tradeoffs, align ambition with organizational readiness, and distinguish surface improvements from structural transformation. Each approach balances speed, complexity, and Veteran benefit, supporting informed decisions grounded in funding, governance, policy constraints, and long-term strategy.

Approach 1: Modernized VA.gov as a Content and Experience Layer - Refresh and simplify the site as a digital front door and app-oriented, without altering what it connects to or how benefits are delivered. This scenario treats the site as a presentation layer that improves clarity, trust, and usability while preserving all existing backend systems.
