Technology Acquisition Center Replacement Model for VA.gov
Solicitation Number: 36C10B26Q0131 February 5, 2026

Dear Evaluation Team, Kaizen is pleased to submit this response to the Department of Veterans Affairs' Sources Sought Notice for a replacement model for VA.gov. We deeply understand the significance of this initiative, as VA.gov serves as the primary digital front door for millions of Veterans, their families, and stakeholders seeking benefits, healthcare, services, and critical information. Delivering a premier, modern, secure, and Veterancentric digital experience is not merely a technical challenge; it represents a vital commitment to those who have served our nation.
As a specialized provider of user-centered digital platforms for government agencies, Kaizen brings extensive experience modernizing mission-critical public-facing systems that serve diverse populations with complex needs. Our work with major state and local government agencies, including platforms serving millions of users annually, has given us deep insight into the operational realities, compliance obligations, and user experience challenges that federal agencies must navigate.
We recognize that meaningful improvements to VA.gov require coordinated excellence across experience design, platform architecture, content strategy, governance, analytics, and operating models. The VA's stated objectives align precisely with Kaizen's core capabilities:
 Maintaining continuity of service for millions of users during transformation  Integrating with diverse legacy and emerging systems through flexible API architecture  Operating within a regulated, highly visible federal environment with proven compliance expertise  Supporting long-term scalability, adaptability, and resilience through modern cloud-native design  Offering seamless customer experience through human-centered design and accessibility
Kaizen was founded on the belief that government agencies should have access to the same high-quality digital experiences as those available in the private sector. Our team includes veterans from leading technology companies like Palantir, Tesla, Airbnb, Spotify, and Anduril, bringing private-sector innovation to public-sector challenges. We take great care in understanding agency missions and translating them into accessible, intuitive platforms that build trust and deliver measurable outcomes.
The enclosed submission provides detailed information on our relevant experience, technical approach, and capabilities for supporting the VA's vision. We are honored by the opportunity to support the Department of Veterans Affairs in this essential mission and welcome the possibility of follow-on discussions to explore how Kaizen can best serve America's Veterans through digital excellence.
Sincerely,
February 5, 2026

Relevant Experience, Capabilities, and Approaches
Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges
Kaizen has successfully delivered modern, accessible, and secure digital platforms for major government agencies serving millions of constituents with complex needs. While our direct experience is primarily at state and local levels, the challenges, user populations, compliance requirements, and technical complexity are directly analogous to VA.gov replacement.
Project Highlight: State of Maryland Department of Natural Resources
Challenge: The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) needed to modernize its digital presence to serve over 6.2 million annual visitors seeking information about state parks, wildlife, boating, fishing licenses, and outdoor recreation. The existing system was outdated, difficult for staff to update, not mobile-friendly, and created barriers for users seeking time-sensitive information about park access and conditions.
Our Approach: Kaizen worked in close partnership with DNR leadership to design and implement a comprehensive digital transformation including:
 User Research: Conducted stakeholder interviews, user surveys, and usability testing with diverse Maryland residents including older adults, mobile-primary users, and users with disabilities
 Modern Architecture: Built cloud-native platform with 99.9% uptime SLA and ability to scale during peak seasons (summer weekends, holidays)
 Accessibility First: Achieved WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all interfaces with particular attention to users with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities
 Content Management: Implemented intuitive CMS enabling DNR staff across 75+ locations to publish updates without IT involvement
 Mobile Optimization: Delivered mobile-first responsive design with 60% of traffic now on mobile devices
 Rapid Deployment: Launched initial platform in 60 days from contract signing, demonstrating agile capability
Outcomes  67,000+ completed user reservations within 3 months via digital platform  98% capacity achieved for most-visited DNR location post-launch with zero security incidents  40%+ adoption of modern payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay) improving user convenience
4

 Zero overflow issues during peak periods due to proactive capacity management  5-second average check-in time at parks using digital QR codes vs. previous manual
processes  Eliminated call center volume for reservation inquiries by 41% through improved self-service
This engagement demonstrates Kaizen's ability to:  Modernize mission-critical public-facing systems serving millions  Balance multiple stakeholder needs across decentralized operations  Achieve rapid deployment without sacrificing quality or security  Deliver measurable improvements in user experience and operational efficiency  Navigate complex federal compliance requirements (Maryland DNR operates under federal partnerships and regulations)
Relevant Ideas, Capabilities, and Approaches for VA.gov Replacement
1. Human-Centered Design Methodology
Philosophy: Replacing VA.gov must start with deep understanding of Veteran needs, pain points, and goals. Technology decisions should flow from user needs, not the reverse.
Our Approach  User Research: Extensive discovery with diverse Veteran populations (age, era of service, disability status, tech comfort, geographic location), including family members, caregivers, and VSOs  Persona Development: Research-based personas representing key segments (recently separated tech-savvy service member, Vietnam-era Veteran, caregiver/family member, older Veteran with disabilities)  Journey Mapping: Complete mapping of critical tasks (applying for disability, scheduling healthcare, checking claim status, accessing education benefits, finding facilities) identifying pain points and improvement opportunities  Usability Testing: Iterative testing with Veterans throughout design and development, including accessibility testing with assistive technology users  Continuous Feedback: Post-launch surveys, analytics revealing struggle points, and regular research cycles
2. Modern Platform Architecture
Technical Vision: Cloud-native, microservices architecture supporting scalability, resilience, integration flexibility, and rapid evolution.
Key Capabilities
