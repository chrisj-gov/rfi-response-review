04/2023-present

Brief Description of Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges

The Readiness and Employment System (RES) is a case management platform used by VA Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors

(VRCs) to assist service-disabled Veterans with their transition to post- service employment. VRCs and Veteran Readiness and

Employment (VRE) Services staff directly use RES to deliver benefits authorized under statutory mandates such as Chapter 31

of Title 38, U.S. Code. GovCIO is responsible for the development, modernization, and sustainment of RES, which replaces and

ultimately decommissions the legacy Corporate WINRS (CWINRS) system. We lead efforts to enhance the VA's VRE program's

digital infrastructure by delivering a secure, scalable, and user-centered case management solution through the Appian Low

Code/No Code (LC/NC) platform. Using this COTS-based solution rather than custom development ensures cost efficiency in

both initial system development and ongoing maintenance, while also speeding delivery of modernized capabilities and

accelerating CWINRS decommission. Our services include requirements gathering, system design, agile development, testing,

deployment, and ongoing maintenance. We also ensure integration through GovCIO-built APIs with 17 VA enterprise systems

(such as VA.gov, WEAMS, VBMS, LTS, MPI, and IAM), manage data migration from CWINRS, and provide user assistance to

facilitate adoption. Our team applies Human Centered Design concepts to ensure a pleasant user experience., and DevSecOps

techniques to ensure that security is baked into our solution, and that our development and configuration processes result is timely

delivery of functional products.

Veterans Affairs

Period of Performance

06/2022 - Present

Brief Description of Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges

Our team provides technical expertise that sustains and enhances VR&E products to improve scalability, increase availability of

services, share and update data between related systems, and enable more efficient delivery. GovCIO understands the VR&E

product landscape, its complex integrations, and associated sustainment and enhancement support needs. We advance

DevSecOps and Product Line Management (PLM) maturity aligned to VA's PLM and DevSecOps playbooks. Additionally, we

have extensive experience with VR&E data management and understand the integrations to provide a cohesive, feasible solution.

GovCIO sustains and enhances the VR&E product suite through a DevSecOps. Our solution advances VA PLM and DevSecOps

objectives through management, sustainment, help desk, integration, and enhancement approaches that promote business value,

workable product roadmaps, metrics, trained resources, and product scorecards. We enhance VR&E and EDU applications,

improving Veteran access to benefits and VA efficiency. Since October 2024, GovCIO has delivered 12 releases, addressing a

15-month backlog of education form updates. Recent efforts include replacing the outdated Web Automated Verification of

Enrollment (WAVE) system with Verify Your Enrollment (VYE), increasing Statement of Benefits (SOB) to 24/7 availability and

migrating the WEAMS Public and Yellow Ribbon Tool (YRT) into the Comparison Tool, providing previously unavailable data

directly to Veterans so they can utilize it to make the best decisions for their education benefits. Additionally, using a federated

approach, GovCIO is updating the VR&E page on VA.gov, enabling Veterans to login to check if they are eligible for VR&E

benefits and complete From 28-1900. Our team delivered Phase 1 in time for Veterans Day 2025, and Phase 2 is on track to

deliver an enhanced claim status and tracking tool by March 2026.

Why this experience enriches our VA.gov capabilities:  Rudisill Benefits on VA.gov - Reduces wait times and simplifies the process of resubmitting applications, ensuring Veterans
receive their benefits faster and with less hassle.  Integration of Yellow Ribbon Tool (YRT) and WEAMS into the Comparison Tool - Provides a centralized resource for
researching tuition support and approved institutions, helping Veterans make informed financial and academic decisions. Previously, in order for Veterans to get information for schools, certifications, licenses, national exams, and programs, they had to access several different tools, and the information was often out of date  SOB - Shows the months of entitlements they have left, which is most often used when they're signing up for school or determining how much more of their education is covered under the Post 9/11 GI Bill.  VYE - Veterans can now verify their enrollment online through VA.gov, streamlining the process and saving time. Starting in August, this will be the only verification method, as phone verification is being discontinued.  VRE Page - We are transforming the current static eligibility page into an interactive and personalized experience with RESpowered display features, a logic-based decision flow, and user experience (UX) enhancements for VR&E benefits.

2019-present

Brief Description of Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges

GovCIO developed, deployed and is currently enhancing the VLM platform. This work is highly relevant to the VA.gov effort

because it involves development and operation of a large scale, public facing web product. VLM is an interactive online

memorialization platform that honors the service and sacrifice of our Nation's Veterans. This publicly available website enables

virtual memorialization of the millions interred and inurned at VA national cemeteries. This platform allows survivors and family

members to grieve and memorialize their Veterans digitally and allows researchers, amateurs, students, and professionals to

share historical and educational information about Veterans and the cemeteries themselves, some of which date back to the Civil

War. As part of this work, GovCIO identifies, integrates, and aligns a leading-edge Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution with

Veteran needs, VA standards, and VA Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In 2022, we received four industry awards for

our VLM work focused on digital experience, Human Centered Design (HCD), and innovation.

We created and presently maintain DevSecOps pipelines using Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC) to support Java, JavaScript frameworks, SQL, Python, Bash, and Groovy following Infrastructure as Code principles, and ensure all physical resources adhere to cloud compliance standards set by the Enterprise. We adapted the front-end User Interface to

We work across the VLM architecture and technical stack, drawing from VA data sources, including the BOSS and Memorials Data Warehouse (MDW), both built on an Oracle Database Management System (DBMS). This includes maintaining extraction/migration capabilities from BOSS and MDW, as well as the data schema and mappings in a VLM MySQL instance to support full VLM functionality.
Why this experience enriches our VA.gov capabilities: VLM is the most successful public facing website in the VA inventory. Our expertise designing, developing, deploying and maintaining VLM gives us unique insight into Veteran and user preferences, as well as architecture, development, release, and security considerations regarding VA's public facing websites.

Mail Management Services (MMS)

Client

Veterans Affairs

Period of Performance

9/2002 - present

Brief Description of Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges

GovCIO supports VBA Mail Management Services (MMS), delivering high-volume intake and routing capabilities that streamline

claims processing through standardized preparation, metadata capture, indexing, conversion/imaging where applicable, and

integration into downstream VA systems. Through MMS, GovCIO supports all modalities of VBA's digital intake capabilities, such

as VBA's Direct Upload Service, QuickSubmit and its associated advanced eForm and Form Validation Service (FVS). The

QuickSubmit Platform eForm service recently released VA's 21-5103, 21-4138, and 21-8940 forms to production receiving very

positive VSO feedback during customer centric VBA partner engagement and the related production pilot. The initial form releases

have been so positively received by the VSO community that VBA's OBI is reviewing requests to prioritize the next set of forms

to be delivered on the platform. GovCIO integrated process enhancement and business re-engineering at first touch by

implementing the basic 21-4138 and delivering dynamically generated 21-4138s that reflect live, insitu validation updates

prompted by the inline FVS. Additionally, downstream process awareness led the team to implement Intent to File (ITF) notification

concurrent to 21-8940 submissions. Our capabilities are enabling Veterans and their representatives to securely submit evidence

and forms online and have those submissions reliably validated at first touch, categorized, and routed into downstream VA

processing systems. Many benefit journeys are document-heavy, and the Veteran experience depends on whether submissions

are acknowledged quickly, routed correctly, and reflected transparently in downstream processing. This work emphasizes high-

volume, digital-first intake that must remain available, secure, and traceable under variable demand, while maintaining consistent

metadata, auditability, and dependable integration into enterprise services that drive claims work queues and development

actions. In practice, it is less about a single tool and more about operating a repeatable, measurable submission pipeline that

reduces resubmissions and prevents Veterans from relying on follow-up calls simply to confirm VA received their documents.

Why this experience enriches our VA.gov capabilities: QuickSubmit/eForms/FVS directly inform VA.gov by providing proven patterns for very large scale and dependable digital submission receipts via over 1.145M registered users, critical user and data validation via IAM, FVS and VA Profile, canonical metadata and indexing, automated validation and exception handling, and event-driven status signaling (e.g., "submitted, received, processing, action needed/complete"). This experience supports the replacement model's decomposition approach: keep VA.gov focused on Veteran intent and transparency, while specialized intake and workflow services handle validation, routing, and integration behind stable APIs. The result is reduced Veteran uncertainty, less rework, fewer repeat contacts, and the transparent timelines and proactive notifications Veterans expect from modern digital benefit portals. During the PACT ACT surge in August 2023, VBA's QuickSubmit platform architecture readily handled the record claim submission surge while VA.gov, VBMS, and other critical transactional services failed due to high transactional volumes.

Brief Description of Relevant Experience with Similar Challenges

GovCIO consolidated and transformed VA's public-facing websites and applications into a single, public facing website (VA.gov)

that measurably improved the Veteran experience. VA.gov provides Veterans with a central point for finding out information about

their VA benefits. The portfolio of web-based sites and tools within VA.gov provides an authenticated, unified Veteran experience,

delivering claims submission, claims status checks, and dissemination of information about the VA and relevant topics of interest

to Veterans. We applied a DevSecOps approach to organize, coordinate, and operate nine product teams that built ReactJS/Ruby

on Rails applications for the VA.gov ecosystem. Our Human Centered Design (HCD), engineering, and product teams included

60 FTEs and encompassed the full lifecycle of Veteran-facing applications from discovery through production support. GovCIO

VA | Replacement Model for VA.gov Request for Information

1 RESPONSES TO THE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS IN THIS REQUEST VA.gov provides a single, trusted entry point for Veterans, families, caregivers, and other Veteran stakeholders. At its inception and during periods of rapid modernization, the primary emphasis for VA.gov was to centralize the user experience, reduce fragmentation, and improve consistency. As the "front door" information source for Veteran benefits and topics of interest, VA.gov is the place where identity orchestration, navigation, content governance, analytics, and cross-portfolio integration decisions must be implemented.

Many of the issues that VA.gov faces today include fragmented experiences, overlapping capabilities, and a user interface that has absorbed too many responsibilities. Over time, solutions developed to address individual program needs have become difficult to sustain at scale. To overcome these and other challenges, GovCIO proposes a value-based approach that focuses on Veteran outcomes and favors incremental, lower-risk changes while ensuring continuity of service. Accordingly, to best satisfy VA.gov objectives, we recommend a federated replacement model. Under this approach, VA.gov would remain the front door experience during transition to a new, enterprise system deployed via a progressive rollout schedule that reduces user acceptance risk through incremental transition, parallel operations, and coordinated rollback paths.

1.1 Relevant ideas, capabilities, and approaches The VA.gov replacement model will evolve from a single, monolithic front door responsible for many enterprise functions to a modular system supported by clearly defined shared capabilities and decision rights. In practice, this means VA.gov will continue to serve as the primary front door for most users during the transition. Meanwhile, essential enterprise functions will be isolated into shared services with designated owners, interfaces, and operational agreements.

To make VA.gov successful, we must observe and learn from large, national public-sector digital access points that often fail in predictable ways. These problems are real, occurring when a singleentry point must handle multiple benefit programs, various identity providers, and a mix of legacy and modern systems. An effective replacement strategy must explicitly account for these failure modes rather than rely solely on platform upgrades. Key failure modes that VA.gov needs to address are described below:

Category Identity
Identity
Identity
Navigation / content Navigation / content Coupling / release risk Coupling / release risk Governance
Governance

Failure mode / what Veterans experience Sign-in succeeds but downstream services fail due to session or authorization mismatches, creating "I'm signed in but can't proceed" states. Account recovery paths are unclear or inconsistent across contexts, increasing Veteran lockouts. Reauthentication prompts appear unexpectedly during multi-step tasks.
Navigation is forced to reflect organizational boundaries rather than Veteran intent because transactions are owned by different portfolios. Inconsistent content standards and duplicate guidance emerge when programs update content independently. Changes to support one program unintentionally affect another because shared components are embedded in a single delivery surface. Front-door teams become the integration point for issues that aren't front-door problems, slowing delivery for everyone. Standards become advisory when enforcement is unclear or exceptions accumulate faster than they can be resolved. Decision-making shifts from proactive planning to reactive approval of exceptions, increasing long-term inconsistency.

Typical impact Confusion, repeated attempts, task abandonment, increased contact center traffic. Lockouts, lower trust, higher call volume, longer timeto-complete. Increased abandonment, duplicate submissions, negative CX. Users can't find the right path; higher search reliance; inconsistent journeys. Conflicting instructions, policy confusion, reduced trust, rework. Regression risk, slower releases, higher defect rate, incident spikes. Bottlenecks, long cycle times, unclear ownership, delayed fixes. Drift from target architecture, inconsistent implementations, higher long-term cost. Patchwork solutions, rising technical debt, repeated re-litigation of decisions.

To strengthen our identity and authentication capabilities for the upcoming solicitation, we are partnered with TrueZero, an industry leading cybersecurity services company, to supplement our team.

VA | Replacement Model for VA.gov Request for Information

GovCIO's recommended approach involves decomposing VA.gov responsibilities and enforcing them through a lean governance structure. Under this approach, responsibilities currently embedded in VA.gov would be decomposed into explicit platform capability layers, each with clear ownership, interfaces, and operational agreements. These capability layers are described below:

Capability Layer Experience delivery
Identity and access services Navigation and search
Content operations Analytics and measurement Integration contracts

Scope / responsibilities Veteran-facing interfaces, design system implementation, accessibility enforcement, and journey orchestration aligned to Veteran intent. Authentication orchestration, session management, recovery workflows, escalation paths, and required telemetry. Intent-based routing, taxonomy management, search relevance, and cross-portfolio wayfinding independent of organizational boundaries. Shared content models, publishing workflows, plain-language governance, and quality controls. Common event standards, funnel definitions, task success metrics, error telemetry, and performance monitoring. Stable APIs with shared status and error semantics, versioning, and deprecation policies governing backend integration.

The layering process is the foundation of a federated approach in which portfolios can move rapidly within clearly defined guardrails, shared services enable enterprise collaboration, and standards are enforced through measurable service-level objectives rather than advisory guidance.

1.2 Case studies or examples from similar environments

GovCIO brings considerable experience in modernizing Veteran-facing digital platforms, benefits

Mail Management Services (MMS) - QuickSubmit and eForms - digital intake, validation, and integration into claims processing
Commercial Pattern
Veterans-facing Services Architecture (VSA) / VA.gov consolidation and scale
Salesforce Case and Claims Management
Appian Workflow Modernization

What it is strong UX expectations, accessibility needs, and continuous delivery. GovCIO supports VBA digital intake capabilities such as QuickSubmit and eForms to streamline claims processing through secure online submission, automated validation, metadata capture, indexing, and integration into downstream VA systems. This work demonstrates high-volume, digital-first document and form intake pipelines that VA.gov depends on for evidence-heavy benefit journeys, without relying on paper scanning as the primary entry point.
Leading healthcare portals (Kaiser Permanente and Epic/MyChart deployments), large insurers (e.g., UnitedHealthcare, BCBS), and major financial institutions demonstrate consistent account hubs, transparent timelines, proactive notifications, and bankinggrade recovery. VA.gov can adopt these patterns while retaining federal controls and VA-specific identity and integration realities. GovCIO supported VA by leading the VSA initiative to integrate disparate content, tools, and brands into a unified Veteran experience, enabling mobile-friendly delivery and customer-first content and design. This work required platform integration, identity and access alignment, and a federated delivery model across VHA, VBA, and NCA while maintaining availability and accelerating adoption. In benefits and claims environments, Salesforce Customer 360 and Salesforce Government Cloud are commonly used to unify case intake, workflow automation, document routing, and real-time status visibility across channels. For VA.gov, this pattern can be applied by implementing case/workflow capabilities as a shared service behind stable APIs (rather than embedding business logic in the front door), emitting canonical status events that drive VA.gov timelines and notifications, and enforcing data minimization and auditability to meet federal security and privacy requirements. Appian (including FedRAMP-authorized offerings) is commonly used to deliver case/workflow orchestration for benefits-style processes where multiple back-end systems must be coordinated (intake, validation, development actions, routing/assignment, document tasks, decision support, status updates). In a VA.gov context, Appian can operate as a workflow layer behind stable APIs: VA.gov remains the Veteran-facing front door, while Appian manages workflow state, business rules, SLAs, and operator work queues, integrating with systems of record and emitting canonical status events that drive VA.gov timelines, notifications, and "next-bestaction" guidance.

Relevance to this RFI
Document and evidence intake is core to end-to-end Veteran journeys; success depends on reliability, first-touch validation, auditability, and clear receipts/status updates. MMS + QuickSubmit demonstrates how to operate a dependable, scalable intake pipeline that supports Veteran-facing transparency while integrating with complex downstream processing. Notably, during the PACT Act surge (Aug 2023), QuickSubmit architecture handled record submission volumes while VA.gov, VBMS, and other transactional services experienced failures under load, underscoring the value of resilient intake design for continuity of service. Establishes "what good looks like" in regulated, high-stakes journeys; provides proven patterns for trust, transparency, and completion that can be adapted to VA's constraints.
Demonstrates how to consolidate fragmented experiences without disrupting service; establishes a playbook for federated delivery with shared standards and platform capabilities.
Illustrates how a commercial case/workflow layer can be introduced incrementally behind VA.gov without a disruptive rebuild; supports enterprisescale orchestration and cross-channel status visibility.
Demonstrates a practical approach for introducing commercial workflow capability without rebuilding VA.gov. Supports incremental modernization of complex, document-heavy, multi-step journeys while maintaining continuity and federal controls.

Transferable patterns
Very large-scale digital intake with dependable receipts (1.145M registered users); first-touch validation via IAM + FVS + VA Profile; canonical metadata and indexing; automated validation and exception handling; dynamically generated forms with inline validation; eventdriven processing and status signaling ("submitted, received, processing, action needed/complete"); downstream-aware automation (e.g., ITF notification); operational telemetry and surge resilience. This supports the replacement model's decomposition approach: keep VA.gov focused on Veteran intent and transparency, while specialized intake/workflow services handle validation, routing, and integration behind stable APIs.
Account hubs ("My" experiences); transparent status timelines; proactive notifications; robust recovery and "return-to-intent"; preference management; receipts and confirmations as a trust mechanism.
Unified account experience; modular capability delivery; continuous improvement through measurement and iterative releases.
Case intake + workflow automation; document routing; event-driven status updates; API-first integration; auditability and telemetry; incremental adoption with clear exit/portability options.
Workflow automation and orchestration; configurable business rules with governance; role-based work queues; SLA tracking; auditready case history; event-driven status updates; phased rollout by journey; decoupled front door from back-office complexity.

1.5 Lessons learned from past deployments Across VA.gov, the most impactful lessons learned are operational - platforms succeed when shared services are treated as products with owners, when decision rights are explicit, and when quality and measurement are automated and consistent across portfolios.  Design for failure, not just the "happy path": Identity mismatches, downstream outages,
and partial completion are inevitable; workflows must preserve progress and provide actionable recovery paths.  Make standards enforceable and measurable: Advisory guidance does not scale; conformance needs automated checks, dashboards, and time-boxed exceptions.  Invest in journey-level telemetry: Prepare for failure states (not only successes), define common event standards, and use SLOs/error budgets to govern release pace.  Reduce platform bottlenecks by building a paved road: Self-service onboarding for integrations, certificates, proxies, and environments lowers lead time and reduces the "front door team as gatekeeper" problem.  Selective modernization beats big-bang rewrites: Evolve Rails where effective, extract services where load and workflow needs demand it, and integrate commercial capabilities behind stable interfaces.

2 DESCRIPTIONS OF RELEVANT TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES Modernizing VA.gov requires more than a new web framework or migration infrastructure, it needs a comprehensive modernization approach that decomposes responsibilities into a manageable structure, strengthens shared enterprise services, and enables portfolios to deliver capabilities securely through a federated model with enforceable standards. To meet these objectives, GovCIO's recommended technology stack and delivery approach focuses on the "platform primitives" that VA.gov needs to operate as a durable digital front door at scale, including identity and access continuity; navigation/search and workflow orchestrations that support long-running and document-heavy journeys; a standardized integration approach; and endto-end observability that ties system health to Veterans' demonstrated ability to successfully complete website tasks such as applying for benefits. This section describes the specific technologies and implementation patterns that support these capabilities, including where commercial platforms can be introduced behind stable APIs to accelerate outcomes without creating front-door coupling or disruption. Also see Appendix A: Technology Mapping Matrix, for a detailed crosswalk from current VA.gov capabilities to target-state shared services, candidate technologies, and the pilots and metrics used to validate each increment.
2.1 Current-state technical baseline (VA.gov) At present, VA.gov combines a JAMstack-style static content delivery approach with SPA-based transactional experiences. Content is authored in Drupal, exported via Tome Sync and a static build toolchain (Metalsmith + Liquid templates + a Node-based CMS Transformer), and then served via S3 and CloudFront. Transactional applications are commonly React/Redux SPAs (vetswebsite) calling a Rails API façade (VetsAPI) hosted in AWS GovCloud. Key platform tools include Pact consumer-driven contract testing, Cypress end-to-end testing, axe/axe-coconut accessibility testing, Flipper feature flags, Sidekiq background jobs, Redis caching, and Postgres/PostGIS for limited local persistence. Operationally, teams use Sentry for error tracking

and Prometheus/Grafana/Loki for monitoring and logs, with CI/CD via Jenkins and/or CircleCI and infrastructure automation via Terraform and Ansible.

2.2 Replacement model technology architecture Our proposed replacement model does not require discarding VA.gov's strongest assets. Rather, it requires changing how responsibilities are composed so the front door is not a single point of failure for introducing and exercising enterprise capabilities. GovCIO recommends an experience shell with shared capability services patterns, supported by an API-first design approach and an event-driven release pattern. The table below describes key features of this approach.

Architecture Feature Experience layer
API and integration layer
Workflow and status layer Eventing and async processing Search and navigation
Identity lifecycle services

Description
 Server-first/hybrid rendering for most pages, with "islands" of React interactivity  Reusable journey modules and a stable account hub ("My VA")
 API gateway + backend-for-frontend endpoints where needed  OpenAPI-driven approach  Pact tests as release gates  canonical status/error semantics
 Durable workflow orchestration (e.g., AWS Step Functions, Temporal, or Camunda-style patterns) for form-heavy journeys  Receipts and timelines as first-class outputs
 SNS/SQS or EventBridge/Kafka-style event buses to decouple user interactions from downstream latency  status aggregation and notifications driven by events
 intent routing + relevance tuning using OpenSearch/Elastic  Synonym management  A/B testing  Separate content search from transactional search where appropriate
 OIDC/OAuth2 session management aligned to VA IAM/SSOe  Step-up at transactional boundaries  Single recovery entry and standard escalation patterns

A critical part of the decomposition process is the ongoing evolution of VetsAPI, which currently serves as a centralized middleware layer between VA.gov and multiple backend systems. VetsAPI offers numerous efficiencies, including accumulated orchestration logic, transformation rules, and exception handling to increase coupling and obscure system behavior. Refactoring VetsAPI toward a capability-oriented platform model aligns with VA's goals for scalability, resilience, and parallel delivery. This includes separating concerns such as authorization context resolution, eligibility determination, data access, transaction submission, and status tracking into explicit services.
As VA modernizes VA.gov, future consumers of VA platform services will include machine consumers, such as policy-governed AI agents, in addition to human-driven interfaces. Preparing for this eventuality requires platform services to be explicit, deterministic, and machineconsumable. Design requirements to support machine consumers and stronger auditability include:
 Deterministic and idempotent operations  Explicit state models and status transitions  Structured, actionable error responses  Clear separation of read, write, and orchestration responsibilities  Observability supporting auditing, traceability, and rollback.

2.3 Technology options for selective commercial capability insertion VA can improve speed-to-value by selectively inserting FedRAMP-authorized commercial capabilities behind stable interfaces. Examples include workflow/case tooling for targeted domains, notification delivery systems, document services, and analytics platforms, provided that they align with VA security, privacy, and ATO constraints. Examples appear below:

Workstream Scope the use case
Define the minimum viable case + status contract Integrate via gateway + contract testing
Identity and access alignment
Documents and correspondence pipeline
Eventing + status/notification backbone Instrumentation and SLIs/SLOs
Progressive delivery + rollback
Governance and operating model

Key Decisions and Activities Select the specific workflow domain(s) Salesforce will support (e.g., claims intake, correspondence, evidence requests, status routing). Define what remains in systems of record vs what lives in the case/workflow layer. Establish a canonical case object and a minimal status lifecycle (e.g., received, in review, action needed , and complete) plus error semantics. Put Salesforce behind an API gateway; enforce authentication/authorization at the gateway/BFF; implement consumer-driven contract tests. Use VA IAM/SSOe for authN/authZ; implement step-up auth at transactional boundaries; ensure consistent roles/claims mapping for case access. Implement secure upload, malware scanning, metadata tagging, routing, and retention policies; connect to MMS/document services where applicable.
Publish canonical case/status events from Salesforce to an event bus; update a status timeline service and trigger notifications. Define and measure SLIs across the workflow: submission success, queue latency, time-to-first-action, time-to-firstdecision, exception rate. Establish SLOs and error budgets. Roll out by cohort (feature flags/canaries), maintain parallel run where needed, and ensure rollback paths (including data/state considerations). Establish ownership for the case/status contract, exception handling, release coordination, and standards enforcement across portfolios.

Benefits for VA.gov Replacement
Keeps the "front door" thin and avoids migrating everything at once.
This contract is what VA.gov renders; vendor implementation stays behind the API. Prevents vendor-specific changes from breaking VA.gov journeys. Reduces "signed in but can't proceed" states and inconsistent recovery. Enables document-heavy journeys (evidence, correspondence) with traceability. VA.gov timelines/notifications stay consistent even if workflow tooling changes. Proves whether the commercial insertion reduces friction and operational burden. Maintains continuity of service while changing high-risk workflow components. Prevents standards from becoming advisory and avoids cross-portfolio drift.

VA.gov's current Rails stack already includes a Salesforce/Force.com REST client library that supports pragmatic integration patterns during pilots and phased adoption without requiring a wholesale platform replacement. These capabilities are best realized through:
 Workflow/case management: Low-code platforms (e.g., Appian) for rapid delivery of case workflows where appropriate, integrated via APIs and eventing.
 Notifications: Enterprise messaging services (e.g., AWS Pinpoint or equivalent) with template governance, preference center, delivery telemetry, and audit trails.
 Search: Managed search platforms (OpenSearch/Elastic) with relevance tuning and centralized governance.
 Digital experience tooling: Experimentation and analytics tooling to measure journey outcomes and equity impacts with common event schemas.

Selective Go adoption. In parallel with selective insertion of commercial capabilities, VA can reduce release risk and improve performance in high-concurrency, workflow-heavy domains by selectively introducing Go-based services behind stable APIs (e.g., submission pipelines, workflow-orchestration adapters, status aggregation, and notification/event processing). This is not a "replace Rails everywhere" approach. Instead, Rails can remain where it is stable and effective, while Go can be used for components that benefit from predictable concurrency, lower runtime overhead, and clearer service boundaries. Go also aligns well with modern developer workflows, including AI-assisted code generation and refactoring, which can accelerate delivery when paired with OpenAPI/Pact testing, security scanning, and SLO/error-budget governance.
All of the technology options discussed above support a federated approach by letting teams adopt a consistent, scalable service pattern without forcing a single monolithic rewrite of VA.gov.

2.4 DevSecOps, testing, and observability as release gates At the VA.gov scale, tooling only helps when it supports a repeatable operating system. GovCIO recommends a "paved-road" CI/CD pipeline with automated evidence and progressive delivery, as described below:

DevSecOps Feature Automated gates
Progressive delivery
Observability Continuous compliance

Description
 Accessibility (axe/axe-coconut)  Security scanning (e.g., Brakeman for Rails, dependency scanning)  Contract tests (Pact)  Journey-level regression tests (Cypress)
 Feature flags (Flipper)  Canaries  Automated rollback triggered by SLO degradation  Clear go/no-go criteria for high-risk changes
 Consistent correlation IDs  Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry-style)  Dashboards for end-to-end journey health across portfolios
 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation  IaC policy-as-code,  Secrets scanning  Automated packaging of ATO evidence artifacts

Appendix A: Technology Mapping Matrix provides a full crosswalk of proposed technologies and approaches, including how each aligns to proven commercial portal patterns (account hubs, recovery, transparent timelines, proactive notifications) while remaining compatible with VA's security, privacy, and integration constraints.

3 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELEVANT TO VA'S OBJECTIVES In addition to the replacement models, workflows, and technology options described above, GovCIO recommends several practical steps that directly support VA's broader objectives, including maintaining continuity of service; reducing Veteran burden and "time taxes"; improving trust through transparency; and enabling consistent delivery across portfolios. This section outlines actionable pilot efforts, measurement practices, and operating-model recommendations that will help VA move from planning to execution with lower risk, demonstrating early value while building reusable shared services that scale across Veteran benefits, health, and memorials experiences. It also highlights how GovCIO's experience delivering high-visibility VA platforms (VSA, RES, PSES, VLM, and MMS) informs an incremental, evidence-driven modernization strategy that improves end-to-end Veteran outcomes while strengthening governance, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

3.1 Federated operating model: decision rights that scale VA noted that replacing VA.gov is not solely technical, success depends on coordination across experience design, platform architecture, content strategy, governance, analytics, and operating models. A federated approach will only be successful when VA clarifies decision rights, enforces standards, and preserves portfolio delivery velocity. Decomposition can be implemented through multiple operating models. Beneath, we outline three viable models (which can be combined during transition), with practical tradeoffs:

Model Composable Digital Front Door
Federated Experience with Enforceable Standards

Description
VA.gov remains the front door experience, but relies on shared enterprise services for identity, navigation/search, content operations, analytics, and integration contracts.
Portfolios deliver experiences while adhering to enforceable standards for identity, navigation, content, measurement, and integration contracts.

Strengths Strong continuity of service; reduced release risk through decoupled changes; clearer separation of responsibilities.
Scales across diverse organizational structures; reduces central bottlenecks when enforcement is clear; enables portfolio agility.

Considerations / risks
Requires disciplined service ownership, clear operating agreements, and sustained investment in shared services.
Higher inconsistency risk if standards become advisory; exception handling must be strong to avoid drift and fragmentation.

Model
Journey-Based Experience Architecture

Description
VA organizes the front door around Veteran intent and life events (e.g., manage health, manage benefits, update personal information), supported by orchestration that spans systems and exposes consistent statuses and next steps.

Strengths
Improves task completion; supports end-toend measurement and outcome-driven delivery; strengthens cross-portfolio coherence.

Considerations / risks
Requires shared semantics across backends; strong analytics governance; orchestration and status models must be standardized.

To make federated delivery successful, VA should establish and publish a decision-rights model that defines what is centrally owned (standards, contracts, enforcement) and what remains portfolio-owned (delivery within guardrails). The table below suggests a practical approach:

Model Identity patterns and recovery Navigation and search Content governance Analytics and measurement Design system and components Integration contracts

3.2 Near-term pilots and what VA should expect to learn GovCIO recommends near-term pilots that can generate quick wins while minimizing risk. These pilots should be sized to prove capability models, governance, and measurement before broad expansion. Each pilot should include baseline measurements, progressive exposure (internal, limited pilot, cohort rollout, then broader adoption), and explicit rollback paths with objective go/no-go criteria tied to journey service level objectives. Suggested pilots are described below:

Pilot Identity Navigation Shared analytics Content governance

Objectives unify the entry point, language, and escalation path for a subset of users while measuring recovery success and the contact center's impact reorganize routing around a Veteran's intent and validate task completion improvements implement common funnel definitions and error telemetry across two or more portfolios to support cross-system debugging and prioritization
adopt common content models and quality checks for a high-traffic area to reduce inconsistency and improve clarity

Through this series of pilots, VA can determine:
 Where identity and authorization mismatches occur most frequently, and what design patterns reduce them.
 Which governance decisions require central ownership to prevent fragmentation.  The integrations needed to provide a smooth and consistent user journey  How metrics correlate to Veteran trust and operational burden, enabling better prioritization.

3.3 Measurement framework aligned to Veteran outcomes GovCIO recommends measuring progress using outcome-oriented metrics aligned to value. This approach avoids relying solely on platform milestones and provides defensible evidence of improvement over time. Core metrics by value category that should be addressed appear in the following table:

Area Experience Access and utilization Costs and operational burden
Equity Population health and care processes

Example measures / indicators Task success, time-on-task, satisfaction signals, error rate, recovery completion rate. Ability to complete key transactions digitally; reduced unnecessary in-person dependency for digital-eligible tasks. Contact center deflection; reduced repeat contacts due to identity and navigation failures; reduced rework from duplicated capabilities. Differential task success and recovery success across demographic and connectivity segments, with targeted remediation. Where applicable, engagement with digital tools that support care management and continuity.

Measurement hygiene is how VA can ensure that the metrics above are credible, comparable, and actionable across portfolios. It establishes shared instrumentation and reporting standards so VA can see not only whether journeys are "up," but also whether Veterans can reliably complete tasks end-to-end, especially through failure states such as authentication issues, dependency outages, and recovery. This discipline enables consistent decision-making, supports SLO/error-budget governance, and provides transparent dashboards that reveal where experience and operational improvements are actually occurring.

Measurement hygiene Common standards Failure visibility SLO discipline End-to-end transparency

Practices Define common event standards and funnels for top Veteran journeys. Instrument failure states, not only success paths. Use service-level objectives for availability and performance, with error budgets to guide release pace. Publish dashboards that show end-to-end journey health across portfolios.

GovCIO recommends applying the benchmarking method shown at Appendix B as a patternbased comparison (account hub, recovery, timelines, notifications, wayfinding) rather than a feature-by-feature mimic. This keeps VA's approach mission-aligned and compliant, while leveraging proven commercial expectations to set measurable targets for journey performance. The result is a disciplined feedback loop (benchmark, instrument, improve, re-benchmark), with gaps translated into shared-service investments that benefit multiple portfolios.
