Section II: Executive Summary & Technical Approach
1. Executive Summary - The CounterTrade Team's approach is centered on improving
identity proofing success, phishing resistant AAL2+ authentication, and post login task completion for all Veterans--particularly those facing aging related challenges, disabilities, low digital literacy, or constrained connectivity. The CounterTrade Team proposes to partner with VA to explore and pilot next generation digital identity, authentication, and navigation approaches that dramatically improve ease of use and inclusivity while maintaining or exceeding NIST SP 800 63 3 IAL2/AAL2, OMB M 19 17, Section 508, WCAG 2.1 AA, and applicable privacy and FedRAMP requirements. Our focus is to help VA deliver Veteran experiences that feel as intuitive as unlocking a phone, with near universal identity proofing success, robust phishing resistance, and strong resilience against emerging threats such as synthetic identities and deepfake attacks. Our Team will provide an integrated combination of advisory services, reference architectures, and pilot implementations that build on VA's existing investments in Login.gov, ID.me, and its enterprise digital experience platform, while introducing passkeys/FIDO2, risk-based authentication, in person anchored identity, and inclusive UX patterns tailored for VA's diverse Veteran population. Details regarding the solution can be found below.
Proposed Outcomes 2. Solution Objective - The Countertrade Team's solution is designed with key
objectives in mind; see below for the proposed outcomes of our solution.  Achieve identity proofing completion rates approaching 100% by combining remote and
in-person verification methods, leveraging VA's VHIC cards, enrollment records, and nationwide facility footprint.  Reduce MFA friction and sign-in abandonment by adopting passkeys and FIDO2-based authentication options that feel like phone unlock, while delivering phishing-resistant AAL2+ security.  Deliver simpler and more accessible post-login journeys so Veterans can reliably complete tasks such as viewing benefits status, scheduling appointments, updating direct deposit, and submitting claims with minimal cognitive load and confusion.  Implement resilient security architectures that detect and mitigate synthetic identity attempts, deepfake biometric attacks, and large-scale credential theft--without forcing Veterans through unnecessary or repetitive friction.  Establish a transaction-based assurance framework that aligns different Veteran actions and services to appropriate IAL/AAL levels, balancing usability and risk across viewing, managing, and changing sensitive information.

3. Identity Proofing & Authentication Innovation - The Countertrade Team will
develop a target-state blueprint tailored to the VA integrating the below:
a. Hybrid identity proofing: Combining remote IAL2 proofing with in facility verification paths that leverage VHIC, authoritative VA records, and existing in person workflows to bootstrap strong digital identities for Veterans who struggle with remote proofing.
b. Passkeys and FIDO2 based authentication: Introducing passwordless, phishing resistant authentication methods (e.g., device bound passkeys, hardware tokens, platform authenticators) that align with AAL2+ requirements and work seamlessly across major platforms and devices.
c. mDLs, digital wallets, and verifiable credentials: Identifying feasible integration patterns that allow Veterans to reuse trusted credentials they already possess, while respecting federal standards, privacy, and VA's risk posture.
d. Risk-based / adaptive authentication: Designing policies that increase assurance only when and where necessary--e.g., elevating for payment changes or claims submissions, while keeping read only tasks as low friction as possible.
This blueprint will also include a transaction risk matrix that assigns appropriate IAL/AAL levels to representative Veteran actions (viewing, updating, claiming, delegating), guiding how VA should layer authentication rigor to match mission risk and user impact.
The CounterTrade Team will define and support limited-scope pilots that allow VA to test modern identity approaches without disrupting existing services, such as:
 A hybrid proofing pilot at selected VA facilities where in-person identity verification is bound to digital credentials that seamlessly work for VA.gov and the mobile app.
 A passkey-first authentication pilot for a subset of digitally savvy Veterans, measuring login success rates, time-to-access, and user satisfaction versus current MFA methods.
 Evaluation of alternative authentication factors for Veterans in low-connectivity environments (e.g., FIDO2 hardware keys, non-SMS factors) and for those with disabilities, ensuring inclusive factor portfolios.
Each pilot will include a measurement framework to track identity proofing completion rates, authentication success, task completion, abandonment points, and Veteran-reported ease of use.
4. Secure & Inclusive Account Recovery - CounterTrade's solution will propose
account recovery workflows; capabilities can be found below.

a. Remain resilient against account takeover, social engineering, and synthetic identity attacks.
b. Offer multiple recovery paths (trusted device, alternative factors, assisted recovery, in person verification) that are accessible to Veterans with low digital literacy or changing personal circumstances.
c. Integrate risk based controls, tightening recovery steps in suspicious scenarios while avoiding undue friction for trusted, low risk contexts.
5. Navigation Patterns & Task Completion - The CounterTrade Team will design
and document task-based journeys that reframe identity from "login screens" to end to end task completion, such as:
a. "Check my next benefits payment." b. "See my upcoming appointments." c. "Submit evidence for my claim." d. "Update my contact or banking information."
These journeys will:  Minimize the number of steps and decisions required.  Use plain language and clear, persistent progress indicators.  Provide error-tolerant workflows (e.g., gentle validation, save-and-resume, clear recovery paths).  Support assistive technologies, keyboard-only navigation, high-contrast and large-text modes, and OS-level accessibility features.  Incorporate design patterns suitable for low-bandwidth and intermittently connected environments (e.g., lightweight pages, deferred API calls, offline-tolerant flows in the mobile app).
6. Accessibility & Assistive Technologies - Our firm will outline how voice
enabled, hands free, and assisted access (via OS level tools and future conversational interfaces) can be integrated responsibly, consistent with VA's privacy, security, and accessibility requirements.
7. Security & Privacy Considerations & Threat Resilience - CounterTrade
proposed solution utilizes Dell's SafeID with ControlVault provides a concrete foundation for hardened endpoints used within VA, delivering FIPS 140 3 Level 3 validated cryptographic modules, hardware isolated key storage, and FIDO2 backed passwordless authentication, helping VA meet high assurance standards for staff and kiosk endpoints.
