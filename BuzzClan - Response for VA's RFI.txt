2.2 Technical Architecture Philosophy Our architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and integration flexibility through five conceptual layers:  Experience Layer: Accessible, responsive interfaces using progressive enhancement, server-side
rendering, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, and PWA capabilities.  Identity & Access Layer: Centralized identity services aligned to NIST 800-63-3 (IAL2/AAL2),
supporting MFA, CAC/PIV, biometrics, and unified profiles.  Application Services Layer: Independently deployable microservices with event-driven
communication and resilience patterns.  Integration Layer: API gateway and integration services abstracting legacy complexity and
supporting REST, GraphQL, and asynchronous messaging.  Infrastructure Layer: Cloud-native, containerized, multi-region architecture with automated scaling,
infrastructure-as-code, and FIPS 140-2-validated encryption.

2.3 Identity Proofing & Authentication Strategy
Identity is foundational to VA.gov success. Our approach supports the full identity lifecycle while balancing security and usability.
Identity Proofing (IAL2)
Remote identity proofing follows NIST 800-63-3 using document verification, knowledge-based checks, and biometric validation. Multi-vendor orchestration maximizes success rates, with manual review resolving edge cases within 24 hours.
Authentication (AAL2)

RFI - Replacement Model for VA.Gov
We support OTP, authenticator apps, CAC/PIV, biometrics, and FIDO2 keys. Adaptive authentication applies step-up verification only when risk signals warrant it. Credential Recovery & Session Continuity Multi-path recovery enables secure self-service for most users, with assisted recovery for complex cases. Single sign-on supports seamless navigation across VA services using short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens. Step-up authentication protects sensitive actions without forcing full re-authentication.

2.4 Known Limitations, Risks, and Tradeoffs
2.4.1Technical Limitations & Constraints
VA.gov modernization must integrate numerous legacy systems built over decades, many without modern APIs or documentation. Building a strong integration layer requires upfront effort but enables phased modernization without disrupting Veteran access, whereas minimal integrations create long-term technical debt. Authentication modernization presents a similar risk like forcing immediate credential migration would increase user friction and support demand, so backward compatibility must be maintained temporarily while progressively transitioning to modern, multi-factor authentication. Performance optimization must balance accessibility and delivery speed; performance budgets and automated testing prevent regressions without slowing feature development.
2.4.2 Organizational & Change Management Risks
VA.gov spans multiple administrations and program offices, creating alignment challenges that can delay decisions and increase costs. Strong governance, executive sponsorship, and iterative delivery with frequent stakeholder feedback reduce this risk. User adoption is critical, especially for older Veterans or those with limited digital literacy; gradual rollout, extensive usability testing, training materials, and temporary coexistence with legacy systems help minimize disruption. Skill gaps in cloud, identity, and accessibility are mitigated through a hybrid delivery model and structured knowledge transfer to ensure long-term sustainability.

2.4.3 Security & Compliance Risks Operating legacy and modern platforms in parallel temporarily increases the attack surface, requiring system isolation, continuous monitoring, and frequent security testing. Remote identity proofing can produce false negatives, delaying access for some Veterans; this is mitigated through multiple verification methods, rapid manual review, and in-person alternatives. Security and compliance requirements can slow delivery if treated as add-ons, so security controls and automated compliance monitoring must be embedded into the platform from the outset.
2.4.4 Strategic Tradeoffs VA must balance build-versus-buy decisions, phased migration versus big-bang replacement, and accessibility versus advanced features. Leveraging proven commercial or open-source solutions for common capabilities while building only VA-specific workflows accelerates delivery and reduces maintenance burden. A phased migration approach is essential to minimize operational risk and preserve Veteran access. Accessibility-first design remains non-negotiable to ensure equitable service for Veterans across ages, abilities, devices, and connectivity levels.
