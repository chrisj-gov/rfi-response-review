Integration with a Diverse Portfolio of Legacy and Emerging Systems
BrennSys has experience operating in environments where modern digital platforms must integrate with a mix of legacy systems, emerging technologies, and externally managed services. Our approach emphasizes modular architectures and well-defined interfaces that allow systems to evolve independently without forcing wholesale replacement.
This integration strategy supports gradual modernization while maintaining interoperability across benefit portfolios, identity services, and content systems. It also enables agencies to introduce new technologies without destabilizing existing operations.
Operating Within a Regulated, Highly Visible Federal Environment
BrennSys is accustomed to supporting highly visible federal initiatives subject to governance, review, accessibility, and security requirements. Our work within the Department of Veterans Affairs requires adherence to established approval processes, documentation standards, and stakeholder coordination across organizational boundaries.
We design platforms so governance reviews are built into workflows, allowing updates to move through approval without slowing delivery. This allows agencies to remain compliant while still responding to changing user needs and policy priorities.
Supporting Long-Term Scalability, Adaptability, and Resilience
Rather than focusing solely on initial delivery, BrennSys designs platforms to be sustained and evolved over time. Our experience managing long-running digital programs emphasizes scalable architectures, maintainable codebases, and operational models that support continuous improvement.
Resilience is built tthis hrough redundancy, monitoring, and disciplined operational practices that allow platforms to absorb change, scale to meet demand, and recover quickly from issues. This approach supports long-term adaptability in response to policy, technology, and user behavior changes.
Offering a More Seamless Customer Experience
BrennSys approaches customer experience as an end-to-end journey rather than a collection of individual interactions. We focus on clarity, consistency, and reduced friction across navigation, content, and user workflows, particularly for users seeking time-sensitive or emotionally charged information.
Our experience with Veteran-facing platforms reinforces the importance of clear language, predictable navigation, accessible design, and consistent interaction patterns. These principles support a more seamless experience while maintaining the security and integrity required in federal environments.
4. Descriptions of relevant technologies and approaches.
BrennSys applies proven, enterprise-grade technologies and implementation approaches to support largescale, public-facing digital platforms operating in regulated federal environments. Our focus is on reliability, interoperability, accessibility, and long-term sustainment.
Platform Architecture and Delivery Model
BrennSys supports headless and decoupled web architectures that separate presentation layers from content, identity, and backend services. This enables independent evolution of the user interface while maintaining stable integrations with enterprise systems.
This approach is demonstrated in production through XENIQ, a proprietary, multi-tenant enterprise operating system developed and deployed by BrennSys. XENIQ utilizes a headless architecture with a modern front-end delivery layer and an extensible backend, supporting multiple clients simultaneously
Page |4

BrennSys Technology LLC Date: 2/05/2026 Solicitation #: 36C10B26Q0131
while maintaining strict separation of data, workflows, and governance. This platform reflects our experience running headless architectures in production, not just describing them in design documents.
Key architectural elements include:
 Front-end frameworks optimized for performance, accessibility, and progressive enhancement  API-driven integration with backend systems using REST and event-based services  Layered environments (development, staging, production) with controlled release pipelines  Incremental migration strategies that allow parallel operation of legacy and replacement
components
This model supports phased replacement of VA.gov functionality while maintaining continuity of service, reducing risk during transition, and enabling long-term adaptability.
Content Management Systems and Content Operations
BrennSys has experience supporting enterprise CMS platforms, including Drupal-based environments, configured for high-traffic public websites and distributed content ownership.
This capability is further demonstrated through LIMA, BrennSys's multilingual content architecture designed to support contextual translation and localization rather than word-for-word conversion. LIMA enables content to be authored once and adapted meaningfully across languages while preserving intent, tone, and clarity, supporting accessibility for diverse user populations, including non-English-speaking Veterans and their families.
Our CMS approach includes:
 Structured content models to enable reuse across pages, services, and channels  Role-based access control aligned with governance and review workflows  Editorial workflows supporting draft, review, approval, and publishing  Versioning and rollback capabilities to reduce risk during updates  Integration with external systems for content syndication and data-driven updates
This approach enables consistent content delivery across portfolios while supporting multilingual access and ongoing updates at scale.
Identity, Authentication, and Secure Integration
BrennSys designs platforms to integrate with federal identity and access management services without tightly coupling authentication logic to the presentation layer.
Technical considerations include:
 Secure session handling and token-based authentication  Separation of authenticated and unauthenticated user experiences  Graceful handling of authentication failures and recovery paths  Integration with enterprise identity providers through standardized protocols
This allows secure access to protected services while maintaining usability for public-facing content.
Accessibility Engineering and Compliance Automation
Accessibility is treated as a core engineering requirement, not a post-production activity. BrennSys embeds accessibility into design, development, and deployment pipelines to ensure compliance is sustained as platforms evolve.
This approach is demonstrated through CARTIQ, BrennSys's WCAG 2.2AA-compliant interactive
Page |5

BrennSys Technology LLC Date: 2/05/2026 Solicitation #: 36C10B26Q0131
mapping capability, purpose-built to address accessibility challenges common in location-based services. CARTIQ integrates natively with ArcGIS and supports fully accessible facility and service locator functionality, including keyboard navigation, screen-reader compatibility, and accessible interaction patterns. This directly addresses a common failure point in public-sector platforms, where mapping and location tools often fall short of accessibility standards, despite serving critical user needs such as finding facilities and services.
BrennSys also employs I2T (Image-to-Text) capabilities to strengthen accessibility and operational efficiency. I2T generates contextual, meaningful image descriptions that convey intent and relevance rather than generic labels, supporting screen-reader users beyond checkbox compliance. This capability also supports automated document ingest and processing workflows, enabling structured extraction of content from images and documents to support downstream operations and reporting.
Our accessibility engineering practices include:
 Keyboard-first interaction models across interfaces and interactive components  Captioning and audio description pipelines for multimedia content  Automated and manual Section 508 testing using accessibility validation tools  Continuous accessibility checks integrated into deployment and release workflows
Together, these practices ensure accessibility is maintained at scale, supports diverse user needs, and remains resilient as content, features, and integrations evolve.
Cloud Infrastructure, Performance, and Resilience
BrennSys supports cloud-hosted and hybrid deployment models designed for high availability and scalability.
Infrastructure practices include:
 Load-balanced environments supporting traffic spikes  Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for global performance  Automated scaling and health monitoring  Logging and alerting for operational visibility  Backup and disaster recovery strategies aligned with continuity requirements
These practices support resilient operations for platforms serving millions of users.
Data, Analytics, and Observability
BrennSys integrates analytics and operational intelligence into a unified platform management approach that supports visibility, coordination, and continuous improvement across large digital ecosystems.
This capability is demonstrated through XENIQ, BrennSys's proprietary, multi-tenant enterprise operating system designed to manage complex, multi-stakeholder platform environments. XENIQ integrates workflow automation, document ingest, CRM, reporting, and analytics within a single operational framework, enabling coordinated management across content, engineering, operations, and governance functions. For platforms such as VA.gov, these capabilities support proactive issue resolution, informed prioritization, and sustained platform oversight.
BrennSys also applies an AI-accelerated development methodology that leverages AI-assisted tools to improve delivery velocity while maintaining code quality, security, and compliance. This approach compresses traditional development timelines for features, integrations, and issue resolution without sacrificing disciplined engineering practices.

5. User journey workflows for identity proofing, sign-in, recovery, and navigation.
User Journey Workflows
Identity Proofing and Account Creation
BrennSys designs identity proofing workflows to introduce authentication only when it is required to access protected services or personal information. Users typically enter through public, unauthenticated content where they can orient themselves and build trust before being asked to verify their identity. Identity proofing integrates with enterprise identity providers using standardized protocols and employs progressive disclosure to explain why verification is necessary and what steps to expect. Clear exit, retry, and recovery paths are built into the workflow to prevent users from becoming stalled in incomplete verification processes.
Sign-In and Authenticated Access
Sign-in is treated as a gateway to services rather than the starting point of the user experience. Authentication state is managed centrally and abstracted from the presentation layer, allowing users to move between content and services without repeated interruptions. Authenticated and unauthenticated experiences share consistent navigation and interaction patterns to reduce cognitive load and maintain orientation. Session handling is designed to preserve continuity of use, minimizing disruption unless security requirements dictate otherwise.
Account Recovery and Error Handling
Account recovery is designed as a primary user journey rather than an edge case. Recovery workflows guide users through step-by-step processes using clear language, visible progress indicators, and explicit next steps. Where appropriate, recovery minimizes full re-proofing while maintaining security and compliance standards. Failure scenarios are handled with clear explanations and escalation options to reduce abandonment and frustration.
Navigation and Cross-Portfolio Movement
Navigation is designed around user intent rather than organizational structure. Persistent navigation elements, contextual links, search, and breadcrumbs support multiple entry points and non-linear journeys across benefit portfolios and information domains. Context is preserved as users move between authenticated and unauthenticated areas, reducing disorientation and unnecessary repetition.
Known Limitations, Risks, and Tradeoffs
Large-scale digital modernization involves inherent tradeoffs. Strong security and identity requirements can introduce user friction if not carefully balanced with usability. Legacy systems may impose constraints related to data models, latency, or availability that limit front-end optimization. Governance and review processes, while necessary in federal environments, can slow iteration if not intentionally integrated into content and release workflows. Without disciplined content ownership and information architecture, platforms risk content sprawl that undermines navigation and trust. Frequent structural changes can also create change fatigue for users who rely on consistency, particularly when accessing high-stakes services.
Lessons Learned from Past Deployments
Experience supporting Veteran-facing platforms and other large public-sector digital environments has shown that incremental modernization is more effective than large, single-cutover transitions. Phased replacement allows teams to validate changes in production, respond to real user behavior, and reduce risk while maintaining continuity of service. Identity services are most effective when they remain largely
Page |9

BrennSys Technology LLC Date: 2/05/2026 Solicitation #: 36C10B26Q0131
invisible until required, rather than dominating early interactions. Recovery journeys deserve the same level of design attention as onboarding, as users often judge a platform by how well it handles failure. Stable navigation builds trust even as content evolves, and close alignment between operations, engineering, and design is essential for long-term platform resilience
6. Any additional information relevant to VA's objectives.
BrennSys brings a Veteran-centered perspective grounded in direct experience delivering and sustaining platforms that serve Veterans, their families, and caregivers. As a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) with ongoing Veteran-facing and VA enterprise work, BrennSys understands that platforms like VA.gov are not simply technical systems, but critical trust interfaces between the Department and the Veteran community.
