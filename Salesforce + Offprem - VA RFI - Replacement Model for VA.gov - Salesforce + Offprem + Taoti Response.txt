Executive Summary
This proposal advocates for replacing VA.gov with a premier, modern, and Veteran-centric digital experience by leveraging VA's existing Salesforce Government Cloud Plus as an integrated, FedRAMP High-authorized enterprise digital engagement platform. This strategic transition would evolve VA.gov from a traditional informational website into a secure, identity-enabled, interactive service platform and the central point of entry for all Veteran digital interactions. By using Salesforce to capture and act on individual Veteran context, the experience can be tailored to meet Veterans where they are making each interaction more meaningful and impactful. This foundation allows us to bring Veteran-specific scenarios to life in a way that feels authentic and supportive. The solution architecture consists of five layers--Digital Experience (Experience Cloud), Identity, Digital Service and Automation (Service Cloud, Agentforce, Marketing Cloud), Data and Analytics (Data 360 with Tableau Next), and Integration (MuleSoft)--to unify service delivery, automation, and data across all benefit portfolios. This unified approach enables personalized self-service, coordinated omnichannel engagement, and real-time service orchestration.
In direct support of the Secretary's priorities to modernize service delivery, improve the Veteran experience, and help ensure fiscal responsibility, a central advantage of this model is achieving significant and sustained cost avoidance by leveraging the existing Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) and consolidating multiple redundant point solutions (portal, CRM, AI, marketing, analytics) onto a single platform, reducing custom development and long-term sustainment costs. The platform's core features include Agentforce for 24x7 agentic AI engagement that can perform transactions and escalate to human agents with full context, and Marketing Cloud to act as a proactive "engagement layer" for orchestrated, hyper-personalized outreach (e.g., PACT Act notifications, appointment reminders). Real-world vignettes illustrate the value of this approach, such as Veterans checking claim status at midnight with an AI agent or receiving a secure, personalized "Transition Dashboard" upon separation, aligning the solution with the Secretary's priorities for modernization, improved customer experience, and fiscal responsibility.
Salesforce Government Cloud Plus provides VA with a FedRAMP High authorized enterprise platform capable of serving as VA's next-generation digital front door. Under this model, VA.gov evolves from a primarily informational website into a secure, identity-enabled, interactive service platform that becomes the central point of entry for all Veteran digital interactions. The platform enables personalized self-service, omnichannel engagement, real-time service orchestration, agentic artificial intelligence, coordinated outreach, and data-driven personalization while maintaining continuity of service and compliance with federal cybersecurity and privacy requirements.
A central advantage of this approach is the VA's ability to leverage its existing and expandable Salesforce Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) to achieve significant and sustained cost avoidance. By consolidating digital experience, service delivery, marketing automation, analytics, artificial intelligence, and data integration onto a single FedRAMP High platform, VA avoids the procurement, integration, and long-term sustainment of multiple redundant point solutions. This consolidation reduces custom development, lowers operations and maintenance costs, minimizes long-term system integrator dependency, and establishes a reusable enterprise foundation for future modernization.
In addition, Salesforce Government Cloud Plus enables VA to deploy FedRAMP High authorized agentic artificial intelligence through Agentforce, providing secure, real-time, 24-hour digital engagement. These AI agents are fully integrated with VA workflows, CRM, and backend systems, allowing VA to extend service availability, reduce call center demand, and provide immediate assistance to Veterans regardless of time or channel.
Together, Experience Cloud, Service Cloud, Agentforce, Marketing Cloud, Data 360, MuleSoft, and Analytics form a unified enterprise digital front door aligned with Secretary Collins' priorities to modernize Veteran digital services, improve customer experience, strengthen cybersecurity, reduce operational cost, and provide long-term scalability and resilience.

Solution Overview
Under the proposed model, Salesforce Government Cloud Plus becomes VA's enterprise digital front door platform. VA.gov is implemented as a unified digital experience layer built on Salesforce Experience Cloud and integrated with VA's enterprise identity, service delivery, data, analytics, and backend systems. Rather than linking Veterans across multiple disconnected portals, this model provides a single secure workspace that unifies all VA digital services.
The architecture consists of five integrated layers.
1. The digital experience layer hosts the VA.gov website and authenticated Veteran portal. Veterans access public information and secure services through one site. After authentication, they enter a personalized "My VA" workspace displaying benefits, healthcare, appointments, messages, applications, and recommended actions.
2. The identity layer integrates directly with VA enterprise identity providers such as ID.me, Login.gov, and DS Logon. Salesforce acts as a federated relying party, preserving VA's identity strategy and enabling seamless cross-service navigation.
3. The digital service and automation layer uses Service Cloud, Flows, Agentforce, and Marketing Cloud to manage all transactional service delivery, workflow orchestration, automated personalized communications and AI-assisted engagement.
4. The data and analytics layer uses Data 360 and Tableau Next to unify Veteran data across systems and provide real-time operational and leadership insights.
5. The integration layer uses MuleSoft to securely connect Salesforce with VA backend systems including VBMS, Caseflow, VistA or Cerner, payments, scheduling, and the Master Veteran Index.
When VA.gov utilizes the Salesforce Experience Cloud as an authenticated portal, it creates a secure foundation for veteran interaction. Integrating the Salesforce Marketing Cloud on top of this foundation establishes a proactive "engagement layer" that transforms the experience from a passive portal into a personalized, journeybased relationship.
Agentforce-powered virtual assistant
Driving Efficiency with Agentforce Integration: Salesforce Personalization (SP) leverages Agentforce to scale 1-to1 personalization by autonomously adapting experiences based on business goals and customer preferences 24/7. With Personalization in Agentforce, websites can become "agentic," allowing visitors to get immediate answers to questions (support, product, education) around the clock. This dynamically adapts the web layout, content, and recommendations based on real-time engagement and conversations, significantly improving call center representative efficiency. This automation reduces the time citizens spend navigating complex systems, aligning with the NDS's aim to address the "cost in time lost by the American public".

Example: A federal agency's public portal, such as for tax assistance or a social service, could integrate an Agentforce-powered virtual assistant. When a citizen interacts with the bot, they receive personalized answers and recommended forms or resources instantly, based on their specific query and unified profile data from Data Cloud. This reduces reliance on live agents, improves service quality, and transforms citizen experiences, addressing the challenge of "lacking AI agents and insights". Upcoming "Agent-First Website" capabilities will further dynamically re-imagine entire web layouts.
Marketing Cloud as an Engagement Layer
Marketing Cloud acts as the "engagement layer," connecting a personalized veteran experience across time and channels. While Experience Cloud provides the place for a veteran to log in and take action, Marketing Cloud provides the reason and the timing for that action. Marketing Cloud's direct impacts are driving portal adoption/usage, reducing call center activities, and decreasing paper mail costs. It uses real-time data to:  Anticipate Needs: Identifying when a veteran is eligible for new benefits or needs to renew a claim.  Omni-channel Outreach: Communicating via the veteran's preferred channel (email, SMS, or mobile push)
to drive them back into the authenticated Experience Cloud portal for secure tasks.  Hyper-Personalization: Tailoring content based on the veteran's specific status (e.g., transition phase,
disability rating, or geographic location).
MuleSoft: The Integration & Data Orchestration Layer
MuleSoft provides the secure, API-led "connectivity layer" required to unify the Veteran experience across the VA's vast technology landscape. By abstracting the complexity of legacy systems, modern healthcare applications, and enterprise data platforms, MuleSoft enables VA.gov to function as a single, high-performance ecosystem rather than a collection of silos.  Secure Legacy Modernization: Unlocks mission-critical data from core systems without requiring high-risk
"rip-and-replace" maneuvers, surfacing it as secure, reusable APIs.  Real-Time Data Orchestration: So the "My VA" dashboard reflects a consistent source of truth by
synchronizing records across VBMS, medical scheduling, and the Master Veteran Index in real time.  Accelerated Innovation: By building a library of reusable assets, MuleSoft allows the VA to launch new
digital services (e.g., mobile apps or partner portals) 3x faster, significantly reducing long-term development costs.  FedRAMP Compliant Security: Meets rigorous federal security and compliance standards for protecting Veteran PII and PHI, supporting the specific FedRAMP authorization levels required for VA's mission-critical workloads.

Additional Benefits to VA:
The Veteran Digital Buddy, a modern AI agentic guide powered by Agentforce and the Salesforce CRM platform, elevates the unified Veteran 1 experience across multiple digital channels in multiple contexts.  When the veteran is browsing the va.gov website but is not logged in, the Veteran Digital Buddy can provide
general guidance about VA programs, benefits, etc. It can also facilitate and guide the veteran through various processes like registering their login ID, enrolling or claiming benefits, etc. All such guidance can be dynamically grounded in the unique context & eligibility rules for respective VA benefit programs.  Once logged in, just like for human Support Reps the Veteran Digital Buddy will know who the veteran is and appropriate access to specific VA records about this veteran. For example as shown above in Figure 1, the Veteran Digital Buddy knows that Charles has an upcoming appointment and then offers to send a reminder via SMS text message to Charles to reduce risk of a no-show appointment.  Salesforce is expanding Agentforce platforms onto multiple channels beyond a web chatbot. This includes working inside VA Mobile Apps, and Agentforce Voice for VA Contact Centers with Genesys CX.  The Veteran Digital Buddy is always available as a helpful guide and concierge for the veteran, but always with the option to hand-off to a human VA Service Representative upon request. Again, both the Veteran Digital Buddy and the VA Service Rep have access to all relevant context and information pertaining to the veteran throughout engagement, hand-off, and disposition.
No wrong door. Regardless of which engagement channel is used by a veteran at any time, they are guided and routed seamlessly to the proper VA benefits, support resources and next steps. For the veteran or registered citizen/beneficiary, the VA `knows me' no matter when, where or how I engage with the VA. If one uses different channels or takes different steps at different times, all relevant status, information, and context are maintained. The veteran & VA staff clearly sees tracking of all prior activities, steps, engagements, etc. No restarts or resending the same forms/documents multiple times to multiple recipients, etc.
Unified veteran context updates can even occur even in real time. Powered by Data 360, sub-second real time features & unified profile tracking, Marketing Cloud Personalization can receive and process updates even as the veteran is navigating or triggering updates on a VA website or via a VA mobile application. For more details, please see https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=mktg.mc_pers_intro.htm&type=5
MuleSoft serves as the data and connectivity enablement layer for the Salesforce Veteran 1 vision, fueling Agentforce and the Veteran Digital Buddy with real time, authoritative data from disparate VA backends. By orchestrating secure data flows between legacy records and Salesforce, MuleSoft helps ensure the AI agent is grounded in actual veteran context such as appointment status or benefit eligibility enabling a proactive, "no wrong door" experience across web, mobile, and contact centers. This seamless integration eliminates custom backend connectivity and enhances the VA "knows the Veteran" regardless of the engagement channel.
Response to RFI Requirements
Through this request, VA seeks information on solutions, technologies, and approaches that can fundamentally improve the digital experience across all benefit portfolios.
Descriptions of relevant ideas, capabilities, and approaches.
To address the Department of Veterans Affairs' request to create a premier, modern, and secure digital experience, the Salesforce proposed solution leverages multiple Salesforce technologies to serve as a central entry point for benefits and services. By utilizing Experience Cloud and Platform, the VA can establish a seamless customer experience that harmonizes experience design with robust platform architecture, so that the replacement model is both veteran-centric and adaptable. Integrating with a diverse portfolio of legacy and emerging systems while maintaining continuity of service for millions of users, MuleSoft can provide the necessary connectivity layer to bridge known disparate data sources, via reusable APIs and integrations. Furthermore, deploying these solutions within Gov Cloud Plus and utilizing Shield directly addresses the need to

operate within a regulated, highly visible federal environment that demands strict security and long-term resilience. Finally, incorporating Data Cloud, Agentforce, and Marketing Cloud supports the VA's goal of fundamentally improving digital experiences across benefit portfolios through advanced analytics and content strategy, providing long-term scalability.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
 Experience Cloud delivers the VA.gov portal and personalized dashboards.  Service Cloud manages enterprise case and service workflows.  Agentforce delivers 24x7 virtual agents and AI-assisted triage.  Marketing Cloud orchestrates coordinated outreach and notifications.  Data 360 unifies Veteran data for analytics and personalization.  MuleSoft provides secure, API-led connectivity that unifies real-time data across VA's legacy systems,
modern applications, and enterprise platforms into a single, consistent source of truth.
Salesforce proposes shifting VA.gov from a reactive and static website to a proactive, agentic service environment. Currently, veterans navigate complex menus, siloed departments and documentation on VA.gov, which can be a time consuming and frustrating experience. What we have termed a "Veteran Digital Buddy," powered by Agentforce, acts as an intelligent and autonomous partner, which can reduce friction and complexity, and take action on behalf of the veteran. The Veteran Digital Buddy can essentially be a unified front door, so that veterans don't need to understand VA's internal organizational structure to get the assistance that they need.
Agentforce is underpinned by Data 360, which unifies structured and unstructured data about a Veteran to ground AI responses in accurate context. This enables the Veteran Digital Buddy to deliver tailored, personalized responses and suggestions, based on the nuances of a Veteran's journey. This reduces the amount of time a veteran spends finding answers to their questions, and also decreases the cognitive load required for certain processes or workflows they may need to follow to receive a benefit or file a claim.
While providing accurate, clear information to veterans in a chat interface is helpful, the power of Agentforce lies in its ability to take action. By integrating directly with VA's many backend systems via MuleSoft, the agent can schedule appointments, update contact information, or check the status of a claim in real time. For a veteran, this means no more switching between phone calls and websites. The Veteran Digital Buddy can serve as a unified interface that maintains context across chat sessions and departments.
The transformation of VA.gov into an AI-powered experience is achieved without compromising the VA's security standards. Via the Einstein Trust Layer, every interaction is grounded in VA approved data, reducing the likelihood that the Veteran Digital Buddy hallucinates. Additionally, Veteran and other VA data is never used to train external AI models. A brief demo video of this Veteran Digital Buddy concept can be found here.
Additional Salesforce differentiators:
 Salesforce uniquely unifies service delivery, agentic AI, CRM, and marketing engagement on a single platform.
 All interactions across web, mobile, chat, phone, and messaging are captured in one Veteran profile. Marketing Cloud orchestrates event-driven notifications synchronized with live service activity. For example, when claim status changes, the dashboard updates in real time, Marketing Cloud sends an alert, and Agentforce is prepared to answer questions immediately. This prevents outdated communications and eliminates repeated inquiries.
 Operating in a regulated, highly visible federal environment - Salesforce Government Cloud Plus provides FedRAMP High authorization, encryption, audit logging, continuous monitoring, high availability, disaster recovery, CAC/PIV authentication, and Section 508 compliance.
 Scalability and Long-Term Sustainability - The platform supports millions of concurrent users, elastic scaling, and continuous upgrades. New VA programs can be onboarded without new infrastructure or separate security authorizations.

Salesforce Personalization (SP) enhances the user experience by using real-time AI decisioning to tailor the web interface for individual Veterans.  Tailored Resource Discovery: Instead of navigating complex menus, a veteran could see personalized
forms, support programs, or healthcare resources based on their specific service record and historical browsing data.  Increased Completion Rates: By surfacing the most relevant content--such as a specific benefit application or a status update on a claim--SP can decrease bounce rates and increase the successful submission of applications.  Proactive Alerts: For logged-in users, the site can display a personalized banner showing the real-time status of a recent claim or medical appointment, eliminating the need for the Veteran to navigate through multiple legacy system pages.  Veteran-Centric Design: SP aligns with the National Design Studio's (NDS) vision of improving usability and visual design as mandated by Executive Order 14338.  Buying Smarter: As the VA is already a major Salesforce customer, adopting SP follows the federal priority to "buy smarter" by eliminating waste and duplication of tools that cannot connect to existing systems.  Continuity and Integration: The solution integrates with the VA's diverse portfolio of legacy systems by acting as a modern "front door" that unifies disparate data sources into a single, actionable profile.  Scalability and Resilience: The platform supports long-term scalability, allowing the VA to start with highimpact pilot efforts and expand personalization across all benefit portfolios.
The Value of Adaptive Websites
The Adaptive Website (roadmap) feature represents the next generation of web design, where the interface itself becomes agentic.  Dynamic Layouts: Unlike traditional personalization that only changes specific content blocks, Adaptive
Websites can re-imagine entire web layouts in real-time based on the user's intent and conversations with AI assistants.  Intent-Driven Content: If a Veteran interacts with an Agentforce-powered assistant regarding housing assistance, the website can dynamically adapt its layout, content, and recommendations to focus on housing resources throughout the rest of the session.  Efficiency and Resolution: This automation addresses the "cost in time lost" by Veterans navigating complex systems, providing immediate answers and reducing the need for live agent intervention.
Omni-channel Value: Call Centers and Medical Centers
Because SP is built natively on Data Cloud and the Salesforce Platform, it eliminates data silos and provides a unified view of the Veteran across all channels.  Salesforce Call Centers: When a veteran calls for assistance, the agent can instantly see their entire website
activity and chat history via a unified profile. This prevents the veteran from having to repeat information and allows the agent to provide informed, proactive support.  Regional Medical Centers: In-person staff at VA medical centers can access the same digital journey through the CRM. For example, if a veteran was researching specific medical benefits online, the in-person staff would have that context ready, enabling a seamless transition from digital to physical care.  Consistent Decisioning: SP helps ensure that the "Next Best Action" recommended on the website is the same one suggested by a call center representative or an in-person staff member.
Case studies or examples from similar environments.
The shared vision for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mission is to modernize its technology and software to maximize efficiency and effectiveness, provide intuitive experiences, and deliver cost-effective solutions. This modernization effort supports the VA's primary goal of providing comprehensive benefits, including health, education, disability, funerary, and financial support, earned by U.S. Armed Forces Veterans. Salesforce

supports this mission with various cloud solutions--including Service, Health, Public Sector, and Analytics Clouds--deployed on Salesforce for Government Cloud Plus and Hyperforce, leveraging integration and APIs, and managing a wide array of solutions for more than 150,000 users, across more than 80 programs, using over 150 Salesforce applications.
Experience Cloud sites already operating within the VA
VBMS-Fiduciary Accounting Submissions Tool (FAST) https://www.my.va.gov/FAST The VBMS-Fiduciary (FAST) application manages over 470,000 fiduciary and 450,000 beneficiary records. It is integrated within the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) to enable the Fiduciary Program to expedite qualification, appointments of fiduciaries, and release withheld VA funds to beneficiaries. It also provides a more effective means for VA to meet its mission of oversight and protection of our Veterans and their survivors. FAST increases the timeliness of fiduciary appointments, reduces accounting disapproval rates, and enhances the ability to manage workload, oversight, and reporting. VBMS-Fiduciary increases automation and communication with other applications that are necessary to provide comprehensive functionality to Fiduciary Program customers.

USDA Rural Development (RD) RD is committed to investing in rural America and driving economic security and prosperity. With a focus on loan and grant programs, USDA RD expands access to vital infrastructure such as high-speed internet, electric utilities, and transportation. Their programs also support business growth, healthcare, education, housing, and other community essentials. To quantify program effectiveness and increase visibility into the mission impact, USDA RD established the Innovation Center to foster centralized data analytics work, regulatory and policy making, as well as partnerships and strategic engagement activities.
In order to improve the effectiveness, USDA RD recognized the need for a consolidated data warehouse. Since they are required to be responsive to data requests from various stakeholders, including the President, the White House, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the public, a solution like a data warehouse would enable them to store, organize, and conduct reporting from a centralized platform. Gateway facilitates simplified access to RD financial data through the interactive Rural Investments Dashboards. These dashboards expand access to data from over 70 RD programs, assisting the USDA in delivering vital resources to rural communities effectively. The customizable views and portal are supported by Salesforce Experience Cloud.
 200 internal dashboards were developed that significantly reduced data request response times.  The public-facing Rural Data Gateway delivers insights into rural areas within minutes.  The Rural Data Gateway comprises six unique views and 20 dashboards, offering categorized insights into
programs, states/counties, congressional districts, socially vulnerable communities, and data downloads.

User journey workflows for identity proofing, sign-in, recovery, and navigation.
Salesforce provides a comprehensive approach to user journey workflows for identity proofing, sign-in, recovery, and navigation through its identity and access management services. These workflows are designed to deliver secure, seamless, and user-friendly experiences across various touchpoints, including Salesforce orgs, Experience Cloud sites, and external applications.
Salesforce supports identity proofing through customizable registration flows, such as the Headless Registration Flow. This allows organizations to design tailored user registration experiences within their applications. For instance, a single-page application can collect user information, submit it to Salesforce via the Headless Registration API, and handle identity verification through one-time passwords (OTPs) sent via email or SMS. Users verify their identity before being onboarded, with security enhanced by protocols like Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).
Sign-in is secured through methods like single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA requires a second verification factor, such as an authenticator app or security key, alongside a password. SSO enables access to multiple applications with one set of credentials, streamlining the login process while maintaining security and protecting against threats like phishing or credential theft. MuleSoft acts as the secure orchestration layer for user authentication and navigation by integrating with VA IAM and SSO (Single Sign-On) applications to facilitate seamless user journeys.
For recovery, Salesforce uses features like device activation and session security. Device activation challenges users to verify their identity when logging in from unrecognized devices or IP addresses, adding an extra layer of security. Session management settings allow administrators to control session behavior, reducing risks from unattended sessions. Custom login flows can guide users through processes like recovering access or updating credentials before granting platform entry.
Navigation and access control are facilitated by tools like the App Launcher and Connected Apps framework, enabling seamless movement between apps and services without re-authenticating, provided users have the necessary permissions. Identity Connect synchronizes user accounts between Salesforce and external systems like Microsoft Active Directory, providing consistent access management.
Known limitations, risks, and tradeoffs.
We are transparent about the tradeoffs inherent in modernizing platforms of this scale:
 Separate portal platforms  Standalone chatbot systems  Independent marketing automation tools  Legacy system dependenciescan constrain experience improvements without careful abstraction layers  Incremental migration approachesreduce risk but may temporarily increase architectural complexity  Strong governance modelsare essential to prevent fragmentation as new capabilities are introduced  Identity modernizationrequires close coordination across policy, security, and UX to avoid unintended
barriers for users These risks are mitigated through phased migration/delivery, API-led architecture, identity reuse, user-centered design, configuration-first standards, technical validation, shared vision artifacts, and continuous stakeholder alignment. Lessons emphasize early veteran testing, automation, and platform reuse.

Lessons learned from past deployments.
Cost Avoidance and Strategic Value By consolidating portal, CRM, AI, marketing, analytics, and integration on Salesforce Government Cloud Plus under the ELA, VA avoids:
 Separate portal platforms
 Standalone chatbot systems
 Independent marketing automation tools
 Separate analytics engines
 Swivel chair processes between workflows, tasks, applications and systems
 Redundant FedRAMP environments

Additional Information
Salesforce Government Cloud Plus Digital Front Door for VA
This appendix provides a narrative description of the proposed reference architecture for implementing VA's next-generation digital front door on Salesforce Government Cloud Plus. The architecture is designed as a layered, modular enterprise platform that replaces the current VA.gov model with a unified digital engagement and service orchestration layer while preserving VA's authoritative backend systems and enterprise identity strategy.
Architectural Overview
Under the proposed model, Salesforce Government Cloud Plus serves as the enterprise digital engagement and orchestration platform for VA. The platform does not replace VA's core benefits, healthcare, or financial systems. Instead, it functions as:  The primary Veteran digital experience layer  The enterprise service delivery and automation layer  The unified engagement, analytics, and AI layer  The orchestration layer for backend integration
VA.gov is implemented as a secure portal and service platform hosted on Salesforce Experience Cloud and integrated through standard enterprise identity and API services. The architecture consists of five logical layers: 1. Digital Experience Layer 2. Identity and Access Layer 3. Service Delivery and Automation Layer 4. Data and Analytics Layer 5. Enterprise Integration Layer

Page 1

Each layer is independently scalable, governed, and secured, enabling phased migration and long-term extensibility.
A.1 Digital Experience Layer (VA.gov replacement)
The Digital Experience Layer is implemented using Salesforce Experience Cloud and serves as the new VA.gov website and authenticated Veteran portal. This layer provides:  Public informational content  Secure authenticated Veteran dashboards  Digital forms and guided applications  Personalized navigation and recommendations  Mobile-responsive and Section 508-compliant design
After authentication, veterans enter a unified "My VA" workspace that consolidates:  Benefits and claims  Healthcare appointments and messages  Applications and required actions  Notifications and alerts  Personalized service recommendations
This layer replaces the current model of federated portals (eBenefits, My HealtheVet, standalone applications) with a single enterprise veteran workspace.
A.2 Identity and Access Layer
The Identity Layer integrates Salesforce with VA's existing enterprise identity providers, including ID.me, Login.gov, and DS Logon. Salesforce acts as a federated relying party, not a credential authority.
Key characteristics:  Veterans authenticate using existing VA identity services  LOA3 compliance is preserved  Single sign-on across all VA services  Persistent secure session across channels
This approach eliminates the need for new credential systems, preserves VA's enterprise identity investments, and enables seamless cross-service navigation.
