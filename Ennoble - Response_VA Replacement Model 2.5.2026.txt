Replacement Model for VA.gov Ennoble Response

Ennoble First (Ennoble) offers the Department of Veterans Affairs a low-risk, high-value path to replace VA.gov with a modern, integrated digital experience. As a U.S.-based SBA 8(a) small business, we combine the agility of a focused technical partner with the discipline of a large-scale systems integrator. Our approach is grounded in a "Client-First" philosophy that transforms routine administrative processes into secure, scalable, and resilient environments.
We understand that replacing VA.gov is not just a technical refresh, it is a commitment to maintaining trust with millions of Veterans. To fulfill this commitment without disrupting critical services, Ennoble executes through three foundational pillars: People, Process, and Performance.
PEOPLE: Cleared Experts & Veteran Advocacy Our workforce is our primary engine for mission success. We deploy cleared subject matter experts, API architects, data engineers, and DevSecOps leads, who possess deep experience in high-assurance federal environments. Beyond technical skills, our teams operate with a "Mission-First" mindset, viewing Veterans not as users, but as stakeholders to serve.
· Continuity of Leadership: We provide stable, long-term technical leadership to guide VA through complex migration waves, utilizing the same retention strategies that maintained operational continuity for our DISA TES program.
· Empowered Teams: Our engineers are authorized to innovate, utilizing safe "Sandbox-to-Production" pathways to test emerging technologies (AI/ML, Blockchain) in Zone D environments before they touch the live production network.
PROCESS: Phased Modernization & Hardened Security We utilize a hybrid Agile model that blends Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles with hardened DevSecOps practices. This allows us to decouple legacy systems safely using the Strangler Pattern, migrating functionality incrementally while the "As-Is" system remains operational.
· Secure Integration: We implement a "Security-in-the-Middle" architecture where RMF automation and compliance checks (Chef InSpec) are embedded directly into the CI/CD pipeline, enabling continuous ATO.
· Data Integrity: We protect authoritative data using Medallion-style pipelines (Bronze/Silver/Gold) with automated reconciliation jobs to maintain accuracy across legacy and modern platforms.
· Low-Risk Migration: Our roadmap moves from Pilot to Full Operational Capability (FOC) through strict "Go/ No-Go" decision gates, validating performance before scaling to broader user cohorts.
· Known Risks & Lessons: Legacy integration can introduce data silos; mitigated via automated reconciliation (lesson from HHS EHCM). Tradeoffs include initial sandbox costs for safe innovation, yielding long-term resilience.
PERFORMANCE: Measurable Outcomes & Resilience We view performance not as a static metric, but as the continuous delivery of value. Our solution supports highavailability operations through multi-region cloud redundancy, autoscaling, and rigorous COOP/DR testing. We validate success through unified telemetry that compares the legacy experience against the modern platform in real-time.
· Operational Resilience: We employ canary releases and automated rollback triggers to reverse regressions instantly, protecting the live Veteran experience.
· Seamless CX: By integrating modular identity proofing and analytics-driven navigation, we reduce friction for Veterans while maintaining strict security controls (ICD-503/Zero Trust).
ENNOBLE FIRST STANDS READY TO PARTNER WITH VA TO DELIVER A PREDICTIVE, AUDITABLE, AND VETERAN-CENTRIC MODERNIZATION.

3. TECHNICAL ROADMAP & DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES
To facilitate evaluation, this technical response is structured to align directly with VA's four core modernization objectives: (1) Continuity of Service, (2) Legacy & Emerging Integration, (3) Security & Compliance, and (4) Scalability & Customer Experience.
3.1.APPROACH TO MAINTAINING CONTINUITY OF SERVICE FOR MILLIONS OF USERS
Ennoble will replace VA.gov through a low-risk, phased modernization that preserves live service availability for millions of users. Leveraging proven sustainment discipline from HHS EHCM and DISA TES, we combine highavailability architecture, validated COOP/DR practices, hardened CI/CD with automated rollback, and a controlled cohort migration strategy. Our approach emphasizes environment parity, parallel operations, and measurable acceptance criteria to ensure identity, content, and transactional continuity throughout the pilot, parallel run, and cutover phases. Deliverables include a phased migration plan, parallel run playbook, and ServiceNow Tier 2/3 support metrics, enabling VA to modernize incrementally while minimizing operational risk.
Objectives & Principles
Our modernization strategy is defined by a clear operational objective and a set of guiding engineering principles designed to protect the Veteran experience.
Objective. Our primary objective is to deliver a replacement for VA.gov with zero or near-zero disruption to authentication, content access, and transactional services for diverse user cohorts.
Core Principles. We adhere to core principles including phased migration, environment parity via Infrastructure as Code (IaC), parallel operations, automated rollback, and mission-driven acceptance criteria.
Foundations (Proven Experience)
Our approach is built upon the specific architectural patterns and operational successes we delivered for high-visibility programs at HHS and DISA
On the HHS EHCM program, we achieved continuous ATO and zero-disruption upgrades for PeopleSoft 9.2, supporting over 90,000 users with rigorous COOP/DR testing.
For DISA TES, we operationalized sandbox-to-production pipelines and hardened CI/CD workflows with automated rollback to protect production baselines.
Migration Phases
We execute modernization through a disciplined, four-stage lifecycle designed to validate performance before scaling. As illustrated in Figure 1, our roadmap moves from controlled pilots to full operational capability through strict "Go/NoGo" decision gates, ensuring that legacy systems are only retired once the modern platform achieves documented parity.
· Phase 0 -- Pilot & Discovery: Baseline "As-Is" architecture, traffic profiles, and critical integrations; select pilot cohort; deliver pilot charter and success criteria.
· Phase 1 -- Parallel Run & Incremental Cutover: Deploy the new platform in parallel; route controlled cohorts via API gateway adapters and feature flags; validate end-to-end flows.
· Phase 2 -- Broad Cohort Migration: Expand migration waves with dual-write or reconciliation until authoritative sources are validated; enforce environment parity and automated smoke tests.
· Phase 3 -- Final Cutover & Legacy Retirement: Execute "Go/No-Go" gates, decommission legacy components, and deliver sustainment handoff artifacts.

Replacement Model for VA.gov Ennoble Response
Outcome
Ennoble can develop a predictable, auditable modernization path that preserves service continuity for millions of users, minimizes operational risk, and enables phased delivery of a secure, resilient, and Veteran-centric VA.gov.
3.2.APPROACH TO INTEGRATING WITH A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF LEGACY AND EMERGING SYSTEMS
Ennoble will execute a repeatable, low-risk integration strategy that connects VA's legacy systems and authoritative data sources with modern, cloud-native platforms and emerging capabilities. Our approach decouples legacy functionality, validates interfaces through model-based engineering, and operationalizes services via hardened DevSecOps pipelines so VA can modernize incrementally without disrupting service. We expose legacy capabilities through versioned API facades and gateway adapters, ingest authoritative feeds into Medallion-style data layers with centralized metadata and reconciliation gates, and validate new technologies in secure sandboxes before staged promotion to production. We embed security and compliance throughout via ICD-503 aligned controls, Zero Trust IAM, and automated RMF evidence capture integrated directly into the CI/CD pipeline.
To visualize how we translate complex legacy constraints into modern capabilities, Figure 2 presents the Ennoble Modernization Framework. This integrated model anchors every technical sprint in specific Veteran requirements, utilizing a continuous feedback loop of Governance, Architecture, and Requirements engineering to maintain alignment. The operational strip at the bottom details our specific "Concept-to-Capability" pathway, moving from secure Sandbox Prototyping (Step 1) through Hardened DevSecOps (Step 4) to a User-Centric Release (Step 6), ensuring that no code reaches the Veteran without passing rigorous security and quality gates.

Authoritative feeds are ingested into Medallion pipelines (Bronze/Silver/Gold) using Informatica/Databricks with automated reconciliation and centralized metadata catalogs for governance.
To deliver accurate, synchronized data to Veterans across the new platform, we employ the Data Architecture figure on the next page. This pipeline transforms raw legacy feeds into authoritative, service-ready assets through automated quality gates.
· DevSecOps, Scalability & Resilience: Utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environment parity, we enforce pipeline gating and automated rollback to protect production. Our Kubernetes-native architecture supports multi-region autoscaling, validated through reusable load profiles (JMeter), chaos engineering, and regular COOP/DR rehearsals.
· Security & Veteran-Centric CX: We implement Zero Trust (CAC/SAML, segmentation) and embed RMF automation (Chef InSpec, XACTA) into pipelines for continuous ATO. Simultaneously, we deploy modular identity proofing and analytics-driven navigation, ensuring 508/WCAG compliance and equitable access .

A resilient, auditable integration fabric delivering a faster, accessible VA.gov experience.
4. CONCLUSION
Ennoble First appreciates the opportunity to respond to this Sources Sought Notice and offers the Department of Veterans Affairs a low-risk, high-value solution for modernizing VA.gov. Driven by the People, Process, and Performance framework outlined in our Executive Summary, we combine a cleared, mission-ready engineering bench with secure DevSecOps delivery to de-risk large-scale modernization.
· People: Our solution is grounded in the expertise of our workforce, demonstrated by the operational sustainment of PeopleSoft for 90,000+ users on HHS EHCM and high-throughput engineering teams at NGA.
· Process: We execute through disciplined, auditable engineering practices, bringing integrated capabilities in MBSE, Medallion-style data pipelines, and ICD-503 aligned security with automated RMF evidence capture to sustain continuous ATO.
· Performance: We drive measurable results through rapid delivery mechanisms, utilizing sandbox-validated pilots (DISA TES) and clear "Go/No-Go" gates to minimize integration risk and protect production baselines.
By uniquely coupling these elements, Ennoble accelerates the delivery of a secure, accessible, and Veteran-centric digital experience. We stand ready to partner with the Department of Veterans Affairs to advance VA.gov modernization.
