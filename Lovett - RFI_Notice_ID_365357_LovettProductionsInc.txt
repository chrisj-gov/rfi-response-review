Allison Fulton, Contract Specialist Evan Schlisserman, Supervisory Contracting Officer Via Email

February 3, 2026

Dear Ms. Fulton and Mr. Schlisserman,

Thank you for the exciting opportunity presented by your exploration of a Replacement Model for VA.gov. Our team has carefully reviewed the requirements and we are confident that we can meet and exceed your expectations across the board. This request in fact, seems perfectly tailored for our company, aligning with both our real world experience and on a personal level.

On the GSA since 2024, Lovett Productions is an SBA Certified 8(a), Woman Owned Small Business, Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise (ISBEE). We are a full service advertising and content creation contractor providing Advertising, Strategy, Original Content, Web Design, Social Media Marketing, Production and Analytics. Our work in the private sector (see p. 20 of the Appendix) yields exceptional, award-winning content and services, combining literal Hollywood creative talent with quantifiable results.

Leveraging that same combination is the core value proposition we bring to federal contracting, aligning us perfectly with your stated mission for VA.gov, "a `premier, modern, secure, and Veterancentric' digital
experience" for your millions of users.

We recently received our initial CPARS assessment for our work with the BLM creating content for a new Visitor Contact Station at the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area. The report includes multiple "Very Good" ratings and many comments about "exceeding performance expectations." We would of course approach the VA.gov project with the same commitment to excellence.

On a personal note, our web team's digital strategy lead also connected with this project immediately: "My late father was a WWII vet, and I've spent hours on VA.gov helping my 93-year-old mom navigate the site to understand survivor benefits. She's still sharp but sometimes experiences "information overload" online. Success for me with the new VA.gov would be for it to be more usable for my mom."

We hope our responses here will provide you with the information you need, and we look forward to the opportunity to continue the conversation with you.
Sincerely,

Danielle Lovett Owner/CEO Lovett Productions, Inc. daniellelovett@mac.com 310.962.7732

Lovett Productions, Inc. Case Studies & Relevant Past Performance
NFL Player Benefits Website
Experience Design & Content Strategy The NFL Player Benefits Office engaged our web team to design a website to help players make better financial decisions, as well as to better understand their retirement, health, and disability benefits. We developed and executed a strategy for consolidating 8 disparate benefits websites; this strategy was based on a user-centric approach with 3,000+ survey responses and 100+ user testing sessions.
Our experience creating the NFL Player Benefits site and app provides an active, tested and iterated realworld example of the ease-of-use journey we would bring to the remodel of VA.org, and to all the veterans, caregivers and survivors that it serves.
For screen images of the NFL Player Benefits user journey, see p. 13 of the Appendix, or click on the internal link.
Since launching the site, we have partnered with the NFL to provide ongoing educational content strategy, management, and data assessment to inform UX and content refinements, as well as new feature design such as calculators and custom APIs to enhance security such as a biometric login for the mobile app.
Services User Experience Strategy & Design, Content Strategy, Usability Testing & Surveys, Visual Design, FrontEnd Web Development, GA4 Analytics, Weekly Project Management Meetings, Quarterly Assessment & Innovation Workshops, Frequent Releases of New Content & Features, Internal Training & Process Development
Account History Client since 2015
Analytics  Best-in-class tool set and test & learn/continuous improvement mentality  Analysis of how players are actually engaging (or not engaging!) with their benefits and using this data
to further improve the experience  GA4, GTM, Looker for reports, and Lucky Orange as a complementary tool  Quarterly meetings to review analytics & KPIs, highlight areas for improvement, decide on actions &
experiments for the coming quarter
Lessons Learned  User research & testing proved to be invaluable in creating an engaging experience for the surprisingly
diverse personas of the NFL, balancing modernization with an older population's "tech savviness" in developing new features and functionality.  Analytics Pros: Industry-standard Google tools, while seeing how users are engaging with page content with privacy/anonymity  Analytics Cons: Lucky Orange required additional vetting steps with Legal and InfoSec teams

Lovett Productions, Inc. Case Studies & Relevant Past Performance TIAA Digital Transformation & Benefits Experience
Experience Design & Content Strategy We helped TIAA modernize the user experience of its public and secure websites for 4+ million retirement plan participants.
TIAA is a mission-driven Fortune 100 financial services firm focused on education, healthcare, non-profit and government sectors.
Multi-year engagement included design of public websites, secure portals, mobile apps, tools & calculators, reporting interfaces, and large-scale data visualization products assessing and reporting on retirement readiness across educational institutions.
Hundreds of user interviews conducted with teachers to help understand mental models to inform data modeling, decision support tools, and web content development.
To drive efficiencies and cost savings for ongoing updates and enhancements at TIAA, we produced design systems and universal pattern libraries.
Services User Experience Strategy & Design, Content Strategy, Usability Testing, Visual Design, e-Learning & Instructional Design
Account History Client 2010-2020
Lessons Learned  TIAA decided not to transform with a "light switch" approach where new websites were designed and
developed in the background  Instead, continuity of service was prioritized while working steadily towards a mission-focused vision
and training internal teams to work with new processes (change management).  "Introduced-goals" help users with discoverability of benefits without adding friction to primary user
goals.  For example, we found a sizable Spanish-speaking segment in hospitals who were not participating
in the retirement plan and sending remittances to their country of origin as an informal retirement strategy; we were able to integrate a benefit-maximization goal to boost participation in the plan to receive the employer's matching benefit, i.e. "don't leave money on the table."
For a typical TIAA user journey map and other screen images, see p.14 in the Appendix.

Lovett Productions, Inc. Case Studies & Relevant Past Performance Johnson & Johnson Accessibility Playbook
Operationalizing Digital Accessibility Across the Enterprise Johnson & Johnson has a sprawling digital ecosystem, with many websites and web applications that do not meet WCAG AA accessibility standards. This vulnerability increases the risk of regulatory non-compliance, as well as the threat of litigation from customers and employees with disabilities.
For this array of platforms, we created an Accessibility Playbook for J&J to guide internal teams on best practices and remediation processes for in-market digital properties with poor accessibility scores.
Key Challenges While J&J promptly took action to remediate specific sites subject to legal action and had engaged a reputable 3rd-party accessibility auditor, a framework for remediating in-market sites and for training J&J employees before launching new sites was lacking.
Services  A custom accessibility content strategy & information architecture  Personalized, role-based interaction model  White-labeled visual design system  Process integration strategy for relevant organizational processes
Our Process Like many organizations, implementing accessibility standards was often a reactive measure - not an integrated part of strong design. Designing a systematic, embedded approach to accessibility meant reexamining J&J's entire process.

Lessons Learned  Accessibility is not just for designers and coders, it takes the whole team working together throughout
the project lifecycle.
For more images from the J&J Accessibility Playbook, see p. 15 in the Appendix.

Lovett Productions, Inc. Proposed Approach: Replacement Model for VA.gov
Experience Design and Navigation  Veteran-centric Experience Design
 Support different audiences, goals, and mindsets  Currently, VA.gov mixes Topical, Segment, and Utility navigation (Diagram 1 on p. 16 of the Appendix)  All 3 types of navigation - appropriately delineated - could go a long way in improving usability (for example, applying the Netflix model, which is successful because it accommodates 2 key user scenarios):  Scenario #1 - The Seeker (targeted, knows what he/she is looking for): Where is the VA Pension application form?  Scenario #2 - The Explorer (general, information-grazing): What are the benefits available to me and my family?
 Establish clear information hierarchy - currently, primary navigation presents users with equallyweighted prompts (Diagram 1 on p. 16 of the Appendix):  VA Benefits and Health Care (arguably the most important content tranche for veterans, survivors, and caregivers)  About the VA (this may be more suitable for roof/footer nav, more relevant for non-Veteran audiences - media, job-seekers, legislative affairs)  Find a VA Location (should be highlighted prominently as a key utility)
Content Strategy  Begin with content Keep/Kill/Modify workshops  Revise/refine content to form "Solution Sets"
 In addition to SEO best practices, there's an added opportunity to package content with AI/LLMs in mind. VA.gov is a prominent, trusted resource giving it an enormous leg up in providing expert advice when Veterans use AI to search for processes or complex benefits. An added benefit of approaching content through a Solution Set lens is to improve not just "findability" but also "discoverability." For example, a user is looking for a Disability Claim Form - in addition to returning links to the online form and PDF, there's an opportunity to present contextually-relevant additional resources (agentic AI tools can assist making suggestions even better over time and help unlock "trapped value" in content and surface it to the right users at the right time on the site)
 Ensure consistency between "Search VA.gov" and "VA Forms" and/or consider consolidating these tools into one (Diagrams 2-5, seen on pp. 17 & 18 of the Appendix)  There is an opportunity to judiciously use Agentic AI to improve the Search experience.  As a starting point, we could map common search queries and form finder queries to improve quality and alignment of results.  To quote Digital.gov, "The search function is an essential component of any government website. It is a critical part of providing a positive user experience."

Lovett Productions, Inc. Proposed Approach: Replacement Model for VA.gov cont.
 Dynamic editorial hierarchy (consider session-based behavioral cues to anticipate content prioritization for a user)
 Content principles:  We follow the principles of the 2010 Plain Writing Act (PUBLIC LAW 111-274) as well as Federal Plain Language Guidelines, which is particularly helpful in explaining complex benefits to a diverse population  Our writers use an "inverted pyramid" approach to webpage content - begin with the key takeaway in a digestible format, then allow deeper exploration for users who want more detail  Based on user research we will recommend where different format types may be most impactful (scannable text, visualizations, videos, tools/calculators)
Platform and Integration Considerations  Modular design system  Pattern library  APIs feeding templates  Integration with legacy systems without a "big bang" cutover  Content mapping & migration planning
Governance and Operating Model  We have helped numerous organizations evolve their web content governance and operating models.
Key steps:  Draft governance framework  Assign governance leads  Maintain ownership commitments  Staff communications & quick-start guides to support change management  Execute content migration & QA  UAT scripts, participants, report  Go-live checklist
 Our expedited discovery process will identify current state pain points and recommend where VA.gov teams could adopt new workflows that maintain continuity while evolving the site

Lovett Productions, Inc. Proposed Approach: Replacement Model for VA.gov cont.
 Analytics and continuous improvement  Adopt a test & learn/continuous improvement mentality  Analyze how users are actually engaging (or not engaging!) on VA.gov and use this data to further improve the experience  Potential tools: GA4, GTM, Looker for reports, Lucky Orange  Quarterly meetings to review analytics & KPIs, highlight areas for improvement, decide on actions & experiments for the coming quarter
NextGen Identity and Authentication We will design VA.gov's information architecture and workflows to integrate with the VA's nextgeneration identity and authentication layer (outlined in the complementary RFI), ensuring continuity across login and task completion.
Our web team designed state-of-the-art user journeys for NFL players to access their benefits spanning signin, recovery, and postlogin navigation as well as alignment between public and authenticated experiences. See examples of the NFL Player Benefits App 2FA Setup Flow on p. 19 of the Appendix.
We also worked with the Identity Access Management (IAM) and Access Control Governance teams at J.P. Morgan and State Street Bank to create UX exception-handling flows amidst large-scale business rule automation and transformation.
Risks, Limitations and Lessons Learned  Avoiding "light switch" transformations (plan & prioritize continuity of service)  User research & testing throughout the process to challenge/validate hypotheses & assumptions  Approach interaction design from both a "findability" and "discoverability" lens  Leverage intelligent automation where it safely and demonstrably creates efficiencies and scalability,
but apply rigorous UX design tenets to anticipate exception-handling  Balancing security, complexity, and usability in IAM work  Accessibility as a team commitment out of the gate, not a latestage checklist  Balancing trade-offs in analytics tooling vs. legal/InfoSec constraints
