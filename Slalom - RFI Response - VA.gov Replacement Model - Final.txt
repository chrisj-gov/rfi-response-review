Our Approach
Slalom reimagines the full digital ecosystem, consolidating legacy components, optimizing performance, and introducing modern content management, data integration, and analytics capabilities, ultimately improving responsiveness, reliability, and longterm agility. Our phased, lowrisk modernization approach retains operational continuity while accelerating delivery and reducing technical debt (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Slalom's Customer Experience Approach Our approach begins with executive alignment, supporting clarity of vision, readiness for change, and a shared understanding of customer priorities. We then immerse ourselves deeply in internal and external research to uncover customer needs, pain points, and operational strengths and gaps, forming the factual foundation for innovation. From this research, we translate insights into strategic direction through design thinking workshops, journey mapping, and experience ideation - defining futurestate experience concepts, measurement frameworks, and the operating models required to support them. The team advances these concepts through prioritized prototyping, allowing organizations to safely test new digital experiences with users before investing in largescale change. To enable secure and scalable modernization, Slalom conducts capability gap analyses and develops directional futurestate architectures, identifying necessary enhancements across data, technology, and processes. We replaces outdated site and platform components with secure, modern architectures grounded in cloudnative engineering, DevSecOps automation, and compliancealigned best practices. Our modernization frameworks emphasize scalability, ongoing maintainability, and cybersecurity--embedding continuous monitoring, threat assessment, and securebydefault development patterns to ensure resilience and regulatory alignment. This confirms that modern experience design is supported by the appropriate technical foundations and governance models. We build executable program roadmaps and business cases, and partner with customers to operationalize new ways of working, embed customercentric culture, and scale modern experiences across the enterprise.

Example deliverables
User Journey Workflows
Slalom's journeymapping approach is rooted in a humancentered, researchdriven methodology designed to reveal how users actually experience a service--emotionally, behaviorally, and operationally--across every touchpoint. Our process combines qualitative insight, crossfunctional collaboration, business alignment, and visual storytelling to create a clear, decisionready view of the endtoend customer experience. We begin with comprehensive internal and external research, including user interviews, observational studies, market scans, and quantitative surveys when appropriate. These research activities capture user needs, pain points, motivations, and contextual factors that shape the journey. In our journey-mapping engagements, this research phase also includes stakeholder interviews, competitive reviews, and CX audits to uncover systemic drivers behind experience gaps. We develop personas or user segments, including demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal characteristics, to ensure each journey reflects authentic user goals. These personas help teams understand what users are doing, thinking, and feeling at each moment and anchor the design effort around real human needs. A journey map visualizes the full lifecycle--start to finish--of how a user interacts with a service. Slalom's journey maps include activities and tasks the user performs, touchpoints across channels (web, mobile, phone, inperson), systems and processes supporting those interactions, emotional states (where users feel confident, confused, frustrated, or delighted), moments of truth, barriers, dropoff points, and areas where friction erodes trust or satisfaction. Journey maps become diagnostic tools that reduce guesswork by showing what truly matters to users and what drives or erodes trust. Slalom uses these insights to uncover systemic issues, prioritize investments, and shape future-state experience design. Journey mapping also helps

organizations see how supporting systems, content, processes, and technology contribute to or hinder the experience.
Identity Proofing Slalom designs identityproofing workflows that are frictionmanaged, multipath, and verificationrich, meeting users where they are while ensuring high assurance of identity. These flows are designed to support equitable access, reduce dropoff, and safeguard sensitive benefits or eligibility determinations. We reinforce this approach with our broader identity modernization experience, where we architect solutions that conform to modern identity protocols (e.g., OIDC/OAuth 2.0, FAPI, PAR, JARM, DPoP, and mTLS), ensuring secure, interoperable, and scalable proofing experiences that can be extended across diverse user populations and devices.
SignIn & Authentication Slalom prioritizes frictionless, phishingresistant authentication, using FIDO2, passkeys, and adaptive risk policies to deliver smooth signin experiences while elevating security posture. This ensures that routine access remains fast, while higherrisk sessions invoke additional safeguards without compromising user experience.
StepUp for Sensitive Actions Because many publicsector and regulated workflows require higher assurance at key transaction points, Slalom implements stepup authentication for highrisk or privileged actions--such as modifying benefits information, updating identity attributes, or approving payments. These stepup flows use the same phishingresistant identity methods but are seamlessly layered into the journey, maintaining continuity and reducing user confusion.
Account Recovery Account recovery is a critical and often overlooked part of the identity journey. Slalom builds fraudaware, selfservice recovery workflows that allow users to recover access through verified factors, backup authentication methods, and--where appropriate--identityproofing resets.
Navigation Across IdentityEnabled Journeys Across workflows, Slalom prioritizes logical, intuitive navigation that reduces cognitive load and maintains continuity as users move between proofing, signin, verification, and serviceaccess tasks.
Limitations, Risks, and Tradeoffs
Slalom approaches any modernization project with a transparent, evidencebased, and riskadjusted delivery philosophy designed to help organizations make confident decisions while protecting continuity of service. Our methodology blends strategic analysis, stakeholder alignment, and safeguarded execution practices to ensure that risks are surfaced early, tradeoffs are evaluated objectively, and limitations are addressed through deliberate planning.
 We begin every engagement with structured discovery and assessment to uncover experience, platform, operational, and policy constraints that may affect delivery.
 We use transparent vendor comparisons, scoring models, ROIdriven business cases, and capability gap analyses to frame tradeoffs in terms of cost, value, security, scalability, and user

impact. These structured tools empower customers to objectively weigh alternatives, whether selecting platforms, choosing modernization sequencing, or determining the level of fidelity required for redesign.  We emphasize incremental modernization to reduce program risk. Instead of attempting broad, fully integrated deployments upfront, we recommend pilotbased approaches that validate assumptions, confirm feasibility, and reduce operational or revenue disruption.  To reduce adoption, compliance, and operational risks, we integrate readiness assessments, governance alignment, and structured changemanagement plans early in the process to prepare the organization for new workflows, technologies, and service models.  We employ disciplined delivery governance through documented assumptions, client acknowledgment of known risks, and appropriate contingency planning.
Relevant Technologies
Digital experience platforms are undergoing a generational shift. Legacy monolithic platforms, while once effective, often introduce rigidity, high total cost of ownership, and technical debt that slows innovation. Slalom recommends a move toward a composable, cloud-native ecosystem built on modern headless CMS and DXP capabilities (see Figure 2). A composable architecture breaks the technology stack into modular, APIdriven components, to gain the flexibility to evolve without the constraints of tightly coupled monolithic systems. Composable platforms are inherently built for change and new capabilities, such as AIenabled personalization, advanced analytics, or new identity workflows, can be added without disruption. This adaptability ensures longterm alignment with market evolution, federal standards, and emerging technologies. This would enable VA.gov to integrate legacy and emerging systems, scale elastically, and adopt best-of-breed services for content, search, personalization, analytics, and identity.

Technology Selection
Each year, Slalom conducts evaluations across the CMS and DXP landscape to understand where the market is heading, how customer needs are shifting, and where the most strategic investments are being made. Our research blends analyst input, peer insights, and real-world implementation outcomes to ensure that any recommendation is grounded in future-fit viability. We have worked with complex integration ranging from securely integrating on premises systems to SaaS products. Some common integrations we work with are shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Slalom Technologies We believe the platform selection process must be intentional, transparent, and grounded in a clear understanding of VA's mission, technical landscape, and Veteran experience priorities. Slalom's approach follows a structured, repeatable sequence that reduces risk, accelerates decisionmaking, and ensures that every recommendation is tied directly to VA's strategic objectives. We recommend platforms that support multi-brand, role-based governance, composable flexibility, and seamless integration with analytics and personalization tools. We prioritize modern architectures built for SaaS scale, agile delivery, and long-term maintainability. We assess platforms based on how well they enable teams across the organization to operate without unnecessary overhead or deep customization. Our platform selection process is shown in Figure 4.

 Step 01 - The Case for Change begins by grounding the effort in a shared understanding of the current challenges, constraints, and opportunities shaping VA.gov today. This ensures all stakeholders align on why modernization is necessary and what outcomes the new platform must enable.
 Building on that foundation, Step 02 - Validate Requirements deepens clarity around business, technical, security, and experience needs. Through structured discovery, we validate, refine, and prioritize the requirements that will meaningfully differentiate Veteran experiences and support longterm operational resilience.
 With requirements in hand, Step 03 - Select Vendor Candidates leverages current market intelligence to identify the most promising platforms. This step intentionally narrows the field to a set of vendors whose capabilities and roadmaps align with VA's goals.
 Next, Step 04 - Prepare Scoring Matrix translates requirements into an objective evaluation framework. Slalom customizes and weights scoring criteria to reflect VA's priorities--ensuring consistency, repeatability, and defensibility throughout the vendor review process.
 With structured evaluation criteria established, Step 05 - Engage Vendors / RFP initiates formal outreach. Vendor responses are collected, scored, and assessed against the matrix to determine which candidates advance.
 Shortlisted vendors are invited into Step 06 - Host Vendor Demos, where they participate in scripted sessions tailored to VA's realworld scenarios. These demos allow stakeholders to observe how each platform handles key functions such as content operations, accessibility, personalization, integrations, and workflow orchestration.
 Following demonstrations, Step 07 - Vendor Efficacy focuses on rigorous due diligence. This includes evaluating vendor stability, roadmap maturity, security posture, and feedback from reference customers--ensuring each option is viable at VA's scale and complexity.
 Slalom then synthesizes findings in Step 08 - Recommend Top Vendor, weaving together scoring outcomes, qualitative assessments, and strategic considerations to deliver a clear, evidencebased recommendation.
 Finally, Step 09 - Readiness Action Plan lays out the path forward, including implementation stages, decision gates, organizational readiness needs, and supporting governance.
Throughout all nine steps, the process is modular and scalable, allowing the VA to adjust depth and fidelity based on timelines, approvals, or areas needing intensified scrutiny, without losing rigor or objectivity.

Lessons learned from past deployments Slalom's CX delivery history--spanning DMV modernization, contactcenter transformations, digital platform rebuilds, and largescale experience strategy engagements--has yielded consistent, evidencebacked lessons that we share with customers to drive smoother, lowerrisk, and higherimpact outcomes.
Timebox Discovery and Align Early to Avoid Downstream Rework A recurring lesson is that discovery phases can easily expand when documentation is outdated or fragmented. Projects benefit when discovery is deliberately timeboxed and tied to clear entry/exit criteria. This keeps teams focused, accelerates alignment, and reduces risk of rework due to missing or misinterpreted requirements.
Establish Clear Roles and CrossFunctional Ways of Working Role clarity across both client and Slalom teams prevents friction and accelerates delivery. Successful engagements employ wellcommunicated RACI structures, blended pods ("two in a box") that pair client SMEs with Slalom practitioners, and clear accountability for product ownership, intake management, and decision authority.
Prioritize Iterative Delivery and Regular Demonstrations Frequent demos and iterative delivery techniques keep stakeholders connected to progress, reduce surprise, and validate design and functionality early. Slalom repeatedly sees that sprintend demos and visible progress build trust and keep teams aligned on the intended customer experience.
Build ChangeReadiness and Organizational Alignment from Day One Large CX transformations invariably impact people, processes, technology, and governance. Slalom has learned to integrate changeimpact analysis, readiness planning, and crossfunctional communications into early stages of CX programs to ensure smooth adoption and reduce resistance to new workflows or platforms.
Ensure Sufficient Transition Time and Knowledge Transfer Postdeployment success depends heavily on strong handoffs. Lessons from past engagements highlight the importance of allocating planned time for transition support, training, runbooks, and operational readiness activities--particularly in environments with multiple user groups or complex operating models.
Past Performance Examples Library of Congress: Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) Project Background: Slalom partnered with the Library of Congress, National Library Service (NLS) to modernize and bring its BARD program to the cloud so that "All May Read." This national program works with a network of cooperating libraries nationwide to provide direct service to eligible individuals and institutions. The BARD website allows approved library patrons or institutions to download BARD content including digital talking books and digital braille books and magazines. While digital access has been available via BARD since 2006, more than 80% of current patrons still use a proprietary talking-book machine/cartridge to listen to content. To accomplish their expansion goals, the Library needed to modernize their content distribution systems to leverage streaming,

voice and modern web and cloud technologies. Slalom partnered with the library to accomplish their expansion goals and capacity to reach and serve 1 million or more patrons.
Project Approach: Discovery began with desk research into the publicly available comments from BARD users from sources such as Amazon and mobile app stores. Through these comments, as well as survey results, the Experience Design (XD) team captured and validated pain points experienced by BARD users. The XD team created three high-level personas, with subtypes for each persona. The personas included blind and visually impaired individuals and captured their diverse needs, such as people who are less comfortable with technology or people in support roles such as librarians and personal caregivers. Armed with this research, the team moved into validation, roadmap planning, and prioritization stages of the development effort. They conducted workshops with multiple stakeholders to ideate solutions, prioritize pain points, and highlight potential interface changes. The workshops guided the XD team in creating a service blueprint, which highlights the future state of all features and needed improvements. As part of the service blueprint, the team executed a holistic content strategy by producing wireframes that outlined the page structures, layout, user flow, and functional interactions. Slalom used an accessibility-first approach to design the hierarchy of information and available features specifically for people with vision and reading impairments. Key elements of the user experience were made into an interactive prototype and tested with endusers.
Outcome: Slalom delivered a modern, accessible BARD application that empowers people with disabilities to explore thousands of books independently. Designed with accessibility at its core, the web-based, API-driven interface supports screen readers, complies with Section 508 standards, and enables seamless use across a range of devices. Slalom's improvements enhanced how patrons access content--making it faster, easier, and more intuitive. These enhancements positioned NLS to reach and exceed its goal of serving over one million patrons. By aligning with the Library's Agile practices and embedding quality assurance and industry best standards, Slalom delivered a BARD application that is a sustainable platform for continued innovation and growth in accessible reading.
National Multiple Sclerosis Society: Digital Experience Project Background: Slalom partnered with the National MS Society to redesign its website, allowing people affected by MS to easily access essential resources and support and empowering them to live their best lives. Over 8.6 million people engage with the Society annually, making it a central hub for those affected by MS. The Society's website is a key resource for learning about MS and finding support and connection. As the website's resources grew, navigation became challenging. The site was also not mobile-friendly for 60% of visitors using mobile devices. Recognizing the importance of a seamless digital experience, the Society engaged Slalom, aiming for a more userfriendly, mobile-first, and constituent-centric platform.
Project Approach: During a 10-week discovery period, we analyzed the Society's user flows and focused on the specific tasks users aimed to accomplish on the website. Constituent feedback continuously shaped the site's structure, confirming it met their needs. We conducted a comprehensive audit, reviewing over 6,000 pieces of content with the Society and removing outdated information. The remaining content was transferred to Sanity, a content management

system with reusable content block templates, making it easy for the Society to update resources continuously.
The integration of Sanity, Salesforce Experience Cloud, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud Personalization created a robust personalization engine. This feature retrieves the most relevant content based on personalized queries, providing quick access to vital information. We also integrated the website with Google Analytics 4 to monitor performance and quantify success. This helps the Society understand constituent behavior in detail, paving the way for future personalization opportunities. We also incorporated SEO best practices, from tagging codes in Salesforce to keywords in the content.
Given the importance of accessibility for those living with MS, we performed a comprehensive accessibility overhaul. The site was crafted to meet WCAG AA-rated standards and, where possible, AAA standards. We validated easy-to-read color palettes, screen reader compatibility, simple visuals and videos, and straightforward language to replace complex medical jargon. Feedback sessions with people living with MS validated that the website was easy to navigate and use.
Outcome: Together with Slalom, the Society has now launched the largest Salesforce Experience Cloud website in production today. At a core level, this site impacts everyone who interacts with the Society. Internally, the website touches every team, streamlining processes and enhancing collaboration. Externally, the website offers a personalized, intuitive experience, providing constituents with a platform where they feel seen and heard while accessing the information they need to move their lives forward.
Retail SaaS Provider: Platform Modernization Project Background: A leading SaaS provider serving the majority of the retail industry was experiencing declining delivery time-to-value and reduced productivity due to fragmented technical systems and heavy reliance on manual processes. At the same time, the organization's private equity owners established aggressive growth targets of 2-3x revenue without increasing headcount. To meet these objectives while improving customer experience, the client engaged Slalom to assess and modernize its technology enablement strategy.
Project Approach: Slalom identified significant inefficiencies caused by frequent context switching across core delivery and operations tools, including Salesforce, NetSuite/OpenAir, Jira, and Basecamp. These disconnected systems resulted in limited visibility, inconsistent reporting, and an unclear source of truth. Slalom conducted a comprehensive assessment of existing tools, including performance evaluation, functional overlap and gap analysis, and license rationalization. Using Slalom's proprietary tool selection methodology, we facilitated requirements definition, vendor qualification, and objective scoring to recommend a modernized, consolidated technical stack aligned to the client's growth and productivity goals.
Outcome: Within ten weeks, the client achieved a clearly defined future-state technical architecture, selected a preferred tool vendor, and secured Board of Director approval to proceed with technology enablement. Slalom is currently supporting solution mobilization, implementation, and organizational change management to ensure a seamless transition. The initiative is projected to

deliver an estimated $5.6M in five-year cost savings and a 445% return on investment, while positioning the organization for sustained, scalable growth. Leading eCommerce Company: Platform Evaluation, Selection & Content Strategy Project Background: A leading global e-commerce organization expanding a new product line sought to accelerate go-to-market velocity by integrating a custom partner portal with a digital asset management (DAM) solution. Both capabilities were being developed from the ground up, and the organization faced significant challenges related to inconsistent content and asset management practices across ecosystems. These challenges included duplicated assets, limited discoverability, lack of standardized processes, and the absence of a formal governance model--resulting in inefficiencies that slowed global expansion efforts. Project Approach: Slalom conducted a comprehensive assessment of the client's current-state content supply chain and collaborated with stakeholders to define business and functional requirements. Based on this analysis, Slalom evaluated and recommended an enterprise DAM platform and designed the foundational capabilities needed to support scalable, sustainable operations. The engagement included development of a content management strategy with structured taxonomy and AI-enabled metadata, creation of a proof of concept, migration of assets from legacy storage into the DAM, and integration of the DAM with the custom partner portal to enable seamless ingestion and distribution of assets and metadata. Outcome: Over several months, Slalom partnered with the client to establish a governance practice defining clear guardrails, roles, and responsibilities for content and asset management. For the first time, the organization achieved a single source of truth for digital assets across their lifecycle, enabling improved collaboration across creative services, brand management, and go-to-market teams. The resulting solution equipped the client with greater operational efficiency, improved asset reuse, and the flexibility to adapt content operations to support continued global growth.
