core of reimagining the Veteran Digital Experience on VA.gov. RIVA's HCD Strategy and Execution processes for digital experiences is shown in Figure 2, below.

Figure 2. RIVA's HCD Process Delivers Customer Experience (CX) Excellence for Federal Digital Service Programs such as VA.gov
HCD is RIVA's process for designing & developing human-centric digital experiences by putting the wants, needs, and limitations of the end-user at the focal point of design & development. Specifically, HCD in digital transformation at RIVA means:
· Discovering user needs through immersive and ongoing user research to develop CX strategies · Documenting findings and experiences to foster a common understanding for our integrated digital
delivery teams · Designing user experiences (UX) to meet user needs--based on user research · Testing and validating usability of UX designs through usability evaluation · Collecting ongoing user feedback data to iteratively improve digital experiences
Strategy. Our HCD Strategy provides the framework to truly understand the people and processes who we will be designing experiences for and create a roadmap for success. This critical--and ongoing--process helps frame the Veteran journey. Using our HCD Strategy, we:
· Discover. We start all projects with immersive qualitative and quantitative user research to uncover existing experiences and user needs.
· Document. We analyze research data and document our findings in ways that are meaningful (using Personas and Customer Journey Maps) and can be used to share with our integrated digital delivery teams.

· Plan. We use everything we've learned about users and their journeys to blueprints, solution strategies, and strategic Customer Experience (CX) Roadmaps which set the stage for successful digital transformation execution.
Execution. The outputs of our HCD Strategy efforts provide a baseline of knowledge for our UX teams to begin the ongoing, iterative process of designing experiences as part of our integrated Agile delivery process. Using our HCD Execution methods, we:
· Continuously Discover. as we begin designing digital services, we engage with representative users and Product Owners to truly understand how specific features and components will be used in their context of work.
· Design UX. using end user and Product Owner input, we design accessible interactions, information architectures, wireframes, content strategies, and interactive UX protypes. We leverage design systems such as the U.S. Web Design System and agency-specific design systems (such as the VA Design System.)
· Collect User Feedback. we are constantly collecting user feedback on our UX designs, often in the form of task-based usability testing, card-sorting, tree-testing, and qualitative user satisfaction ratings.
This cycle of research, design, and testing aligns with our Agile delivery process. From a timing and cadence perspective, we often use dual-track agility methods, keeping the UX team ahead of development.
Continuous Improvement. Our HCD approach continues once digital solutions and service are in production. We are constantly collecting quantitative and qualitative data to drive CX improvement. Typical feedback we collect includes:
· Digital Analytics. Digital service usage data from sources that provide insights into user behavior · Qualitative Measures. User feedback tools, such as surveys, embedded into digital services and
ongoing user engagement · System Data. System performance metrics that correlate with user experiences
Our HCD team continually analyzes this flow of rich Customer Experience (CX) data for insights to channel into the iterative, agile, feedback loop. The result is positive backlog flow--as new features and improvements are delivered, there is a steady stream of customer feedback data to inform improvements or provide insights into possible new system enhancements.
Using this HCD process, RIVA has designed multiple highly visible Federal websites using the USWDS, including a complete redesign of USDA.gov (2025) and ongoing AHRQ.gov design.

Figure 3, above, shows a sample of how RIVA customized USWDS to meet USDA's needs and remain compliant with the 21st Century IDEA.
2.2 Optimal Outcomes - RIVA's Digital Delivery Framework for VA.gov Modernization
Complementing our iDX framework is RIVA digital service execution model, which aligns well with VA's approach to digital product delivery--The VA Way. While many vendors offer digital solutions for government, focusing on project outputs, such as the number of features delivered. Here at RIVA we take a different approach, treating IT projects as products and prioritizing outcomes over outputs. Our approach is Optimal Outcomes and is the unique mindset and methodology that RIVA brings to digital product delivery. In alignment with VA's product delivery model, we continuously deliver business value for VA and their customers--Veterans and their families. Our integrated methodologies--Product Management, Agile Delivery Human Centered Design (HCD), DevSecOps, and Change Enablement and teams allow us to design, develop, and evolve digital products which incrementally deliver business value, are highly usable, and use innovative technology.

Figure 4. RIVA's Optimal Outcomes Framework
As shown in Figure 4, above, our Optimal Outcomes model is both a mindset and an integrated framework of delivery methodologies, based on four pillars:
1. Relentless Focus on Mission. An optimal outcome is one that helps our clients execute their missions better and faster.
2. Holistic Experiences. We deliver highly-usable experiences for all users--from developers to respective product customers and their audiences.
3. A Product Mindset. We align with a product vision and roadmap, focusing on outcomes and results. 4. Continuous, Incremental, Delivery of Business Value. Using value-based Product Management and
Agile delivery, producing valuable, measurable, outcomes at every stage.
To execute our Optimal Outcomes framework while executing the reimagination of the VA.gov ecosystem and digital experience, we synchronize key methodologies that are embraced at VA, including:
· Product Management. Embracing a Product Mindset that continuously delivers valuable outcomes. · Human Centered Design. Drive the design of optimal Customer Experiences · Agile Delivery. Utilizing Product Roadmaps and Minimum Viable Products (MVP's) to deliver value. · DevSecOps. Leveraging secure automated delivery in the cloud. · Change Enablement. The evolution of Change Management, to include agency employees in the
modernization process and ensure their customer experience is as good as external experiences.

With a product mindset focused on outcomes, we establish the definition of "value" during our Immerse phase. This is critical, as it helps to prioritize MVP's on the Product Roadmap and allows us to measure the delivery of valuable outcomes--and continuously improve based on data. This framework can be applied to almost any digital product--from large scale enterprise web portfolios like VA.gov, to complex application development on internal and external systems.
With Product Management and Agile as the backbone of Optimal Outcomes, our process is based on the continuous, incremental, flow of outputs that always provide business value. We utilize continuously repeating, short-cycle phases to always be delivering, learning, and evolving. These short-cycles flow from Immerse, Design, Plan, Deliver, and Evolve phases and drive continuous product evolution.
· Immerse. our integrated delivery team conducts product discovery to gain an understanding of user needs, agency and business goals, and the technical environment and direction.
· Design. using our findings from the Immerse phase, we design solutions, including user experiences, technical architectures, data strategies, and security models.
· Plan. during the Plan phase, we plan and define critical Agile steps and artifacts, including sprint planning, and detailed user stories--focusing on definitions of `ready for development', and `done'.
· Deliver. Delivery is where products are built and delivered. It includes Code, Build, Test, and Release. · Evolve. with product released, we continuously measure performance, prioritize improvements based
on data, and flow into a new Optimal Outcomes cycle to improve and continuously evolve product.
Our Optimal Outcomes framework is highly flexible and can easily adapt to any technical product delivery scenario, from actual product (software) development to a "software factory" support and evolution model.
2.3 FuseFlow.ai - RIVA's AI Accleration Platform for Digital Experience

As part of this effort, RIVA completely redesigned USDA.gov, the Department's flagship site, while maintaining full continuity of service for a broad user base (the site receives approximately 60 million annual visitors). We migrated approximately 60,000 pages of content from the legacy platform into a new Drupal content management system without major downtime. Throughout the multi-year modernization, our team provided 24/7 operations and maintenance, including real-time monitoring and rapid incident response, to ensure USDA.gov and dozens of associated sites remained available and secure for millions of public and internal users. All work was performed in a highly regulated, high-visibility federal environment, adhering to 21st Century IDEA, OMB "Digital-First" policies, and Section 508 accessibility standards to guarantee that USDA's online services are accessible, mobile-friendly, and secure.
Integrating a Diverse Portfolio. RIVA's approach unified a diverse portfolio of legacy and emerging systems onto one enterprise platform. We transitioned USDA.gov from a legacy TeamSite CMS to a modern Drupal environment, which USDA selected as its new standard for all public websites. In doing so, we consolidated 50+ disparate websites (spanning many USDA mission areas, from Drought.gov to Farmers.gov) onto the common Drupal platform. This enterprise solution now supports over 2 million content files across 12 departmental offices on a unified infrastructure. RIVA's team migrated and integrated content from various legacy systems into Drupal, often automating content import to preserve continuity. Where appropriate, we also employed static site generation and headless integration (using tools like Jekyll and similar static compilers) for certain sub-sites, demonstrating the flexibility to incorporate emerging web technologies alongside the main Drupal platform. On the front-end, we standardized the user interface using the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) for a consistent look and feel across all USDA websites. This ensures branding and navigation remain uniform, allowing users to seamlessly move between USDA agency sites with a familiar experience. All new sites were built to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly by design, and content managers benefit from a common Drupal toolset rather than a patchwork of legacy CMSs. By integrating enterprise authentication, analytics, and search components, the modernized USDA.gov platform also interfaces smoothly with other USDA systems and data sources - without disrupting legacy workflows - truly blending old and new into one coherent ecosystem.
Scalability, Reliability & DevOps. Operating USDA's web presence in a mission-critical environment required a solution that is scalable, adaptable, and resilient long-term. RIVA engineered a cloud-hosted, containerized infrastructure to meet this need. All Drupal websites are deployed in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes (via Rancher) within USDA's cloud environments. We utilized both AWS and Azure GovCloud resources for high availability, in line with USDA's Enterprise Web Application Platform

Services (eWAPS) architecture. This modern DevOps setup allows on-demand scaling and robust failover - for example, we can scale out to handle traffic surges (such as during a popular program launch) or recover services rapidly in the event of any component failure. RIVA implemented CI/CD automation through version-controlled pipelines (integrated with Git repositories on Bitbucket/GitHub) to build, test, and deploy updates with minimal downtime. Patches and enhancements that once took weeks under legacy processes are now released continuously in a controlled, automated fashion. To ensure resilience, we put comprehensive monitoring and alerting in place: using tools like Datadog and Splunk for performance monitoring and log analysis, and external uptime monitors to alert our team of any issues proactively. Our DevOps engineers provided 24/7 on-call support, resolving incidents often before end-users even noticed thanks to automated alerts and rapid response procedures. Over the course of the BPA, RIVA demonstrated adaptability by scaling our team and resources to meet evolving needs - ramping up from a core team of ~40 to ~50 technical staff at peak periods - without compromising quality or schedule. This scalable resourcing, combined with the robust cloud architecture, enabled continuous operations with virtually zero unplanned downtime for USDA.gov and its sister sites throughout the engagement. The platform's built-in redundancy and our rigorous disaster recovery practices (e.g. weekly full backups for all sites, including USDA.gov, Farmers.gov, etc.) have ensured that continuity of service is maintained even under unexpected events, fulfilling the mission-critical uptime requirements of a Cabinet-level agency site.
Seamless User Experience Improvements. Ultimately, RIVA's modernization of USDA.gov delivered a significantly enhanced and more seamless customer experience for both the public and USDA's stakeholders. The new USDA.gov features a mobile-responsive design, improved navigation, and a unified visual style that make it easier for users to find information and complete tasks. We reorganized and simplified the site's information architecture based on human-centered design research and analytics (aligning menus and content structure with top user tasks), which led to measurable usability gains - early post-launch metrics showed higher task-completion rates and reduced bounce rates compared to the old site. Because all 50+ modernized USDA sites now share common design patterns and navigation, users can traverse from, say, a mission-area subsite back to USDA.gov or to another program site without confusion, enjoying a consistent look and feel throughout their journey. We also upgraded the site search functionality to use an enterprise search engine (Apache Solr), enabling fast, relevant search results with filtering across tens of thousands of pages. This meant customers of USDA.gov can quickly find content across the Department's wide-ranging information domains, a critical improvement given the volume of content (the unified search indexes millions of records across USDA websites). Importantly, RIVA's team made huge strides in web accessibility and compliance - all new sites meet Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring users of all abilities have equal access. In fact, some legacy USDA sites that scored in single digits for accessibility (just ~4% compliance) were brought up to 97% compliance after our remediation efforts. By delivering a modern, intuitive interface and seamless user experience - while invisibly integrating myriad systems on the back-end - RIVA not only maintained continuity for millions of users, but greatly improved how those users interact with USDA's online services. Every aspect of the USDA.gov modernization, from performance and uptime to content findability and accessibility, now supports the Department's mission with a platform that is scalable, adaptable, and user-centric for the long run.
HHS CMS Health Insurance Oversight System (HIOS) (CMS-2024-20F0001-RIVA). RIVA Solutions served as a prime contractor on the HHS CMS HIOS, a mission-critical backbone of the ACA Marketplace. Our team ensured uninterrupted operations of this system-of-systems, which aggregates insurance data for Healthcare.gov and supports tens of thousands of users each month. We maintained 99.9%+ uptime even during peak enrollment periods, with no major outages or data loss. This reliability was vital to millions of Americans relying on ACA programs, as HIOS feeds key information to Healthcare.gov. Through proactive capacity planning (e.g. scaling infrastructure before open enrollment surges) and robust disaster recovery/COOP support, RIVA sustained continuous service and met all Service Level Agreements for availability and responsiveness. Notably, in a recent year HIOS had zero high-severity incidents and processed 67,000+ monthly data submissions/reports without issue, underscoring our successful O&M execution.

Integration & Regulatory Environment. RIVA managed HIOS's 22 interrelated modules and numerous interfaces in a complex federal IT ecosystem. We integrated HIOS with a diverse portfolio of legacy and emerging systems, from on-premises databases to modern cloud services. For example, our team modernized HIOS's data exchange layer by replacing legacy batch feeds with secure REST APIs and automated pipelines, enabling real-time data sharing with federal and state systems (e.g. CMS MIDAS analytics, state insurance regulators). At the same time, we ensured backward compatibility with older partners (like NAIC file transfers) to avoid disruption. Operating in a highly regulated, high-visibility environment, we rigorously adhered to HHS's security and compliance standards. HIOS is governed by ACA mandates and strict federal regulations (e.g. HIPAA, FISMA), so RIVA implemented DevSecOps best practices to meet these demands. We embedded security and quality checks into our CI/CD pipeline (e.g. Fortify static code scans and 508 accessibility testing in each build) and resolved all critical vulnerabilities within required timeframes. Our team's diligence kept HIOS fully accredited (ATO) with 100% security compliance throughout the contract. We also led a major Section 508 accessibility remediation, fixing over 437 accessibility issues and achieving WCAG compliance across HIOS's web interfaces. This tight integration of compliance, security, and performance management in a collaborative environment resulted in exceptional CPAR ratings from HHS and recognition of RIVA's work as a model for other programs.
Scalability, Adaptability & Resilience. Over a decade-long engagement (2015-2025), RIVA continuously modernized HIOS's technology stack to ensure long-term scalability and resilience. We migrated HIOS to the AWS GovCloud and re-architected critical components into containerized microservices. Legacy Java EE and .NET modules were refactored into Spring Boot services running in Docker containers on AWS ECS/Fargate, improving horizontal scalability and fault isolation. This cloud-native architecture, combined with AWS auto-scaling and multi-AZ deployments, enabled HIOS to handle traffic spikes without downtime. For example, after our optimizations, the system seamlessly supported the addition of five new ACA data modules with a 100% success submission rate on day one (no user failures). We also implemented robust DevOps pipelines (Git-based source control and CI/CD automation with Jenkins) to accelerate delivery. As a result, release deployments that once took 3+ hours of downtime were reduced to ~30 minutes with zero downtime using blue-green deployment strategies. RIVA's innovations improved not only performance but also cost-efficiency - our open-source stack adoption (e.g. migrating from SQL Server to PostgreSQL) saved an estimated $1.3M annually in licensing and infrastructure costs. Throughout, we maintained rigorous continuity measures (active monitoring, automated failovers, regular DR drills), ensuring HIOS stayed highly resilient and adaptable to changing needs. The system consistently met or exceeded its scalability targets, with throughput increasing in step with new regulatory requirements but no degradation in user experience or stability.
Enhanced Customer Experience. Finally, RIVA's stewardship of HIOS delivered a more seamless user experience for both external and internal stakeholders. We revitalized the HIOS web portal by introducing a modern React/TypeScript front-end aligned with the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) standards. This provided a cohesive, user-friendly interface across all modules, similar in look and feel to Healthcare.gov, and ensured mobile-responsive, accessible interactions. Through continuous usability enhancements and performance tuning (e.g. implementing caching for frequently used data to load key pages 3-4× faster), we made it easier for issuers, state regulators, and HHS analysts to accomplish their tasks. Equally important, our focus on accessibility and customer support removed friction for users: after our 508 compliance initiative, all HIOS features became accessible to users with disabilities, and we instituted comprehensive user training, documentation, and a responsive help desk. These efforts paid off in measurable outcomes - user error rates dropped to virtually zero, and stakeholder surveys showed 95%+ satisfaction with the system's improvements. Every monthly release was accompanied by webinars or demos to familiarize users with new features, leading to smooth adoption. In sum, RIVA's work on HIOS maintained critical services for millions, integrated disparate systems, upheld federal compliance, future-proofed the platform, and delivered a better user experience. This past performance attests to our ability to drive reliability, innovation, and customer success on high-visibility federal programs.

NOAA CoastWatch (1332KP21CNAAA0013). RIVA Solutions has ensured uninterrupted service delivery for the CoastWatch/OceanWatch program through multiple contract iterations. As the 3rd/4thiteration incumbent prime, RIVA provides continuous, reliable access to mission-critical satellite data for a vast user base - over 125,000 global users including scientists, resource managers, and the general public. We have maintained near-100% system availability, exceeding uptime Service Level Agreements (achieving ~99.7% uptime vs. 96.7% required) to prevent any data-access gaps for end users. Operating in a high-visibility federal environment, the team rigorously meets NOAA's stringent operational standards. We obtained Authority to Operate (ATO) for this mission-critical system and uphold federal IT/security and data accessibility policies (including Section 508 compliance for web content) to sustain trust and compliance in this regulated domain. This proven stability and adherence to NOAA's regulations have preserved continuity of service for the community even as program needs evolved, a fact recognized by NOAA leadership.
Integration of Legacy and Emerging Systems. RIVA modernized the CoastWatch/OceanWatch platform, integrating a diverse portfolio of legacy systems and new technologies into a unified, user-friendly solution. We transformed a traditional LAMP-based website into a modern Drupal 10 content management system, consolidating content and data from numerous disparate sources. This migration involved merging legacy databases, websites, and scientific data archives into a single open-source web portal while preserving all existing data and functionality. The result is a cohesive portal that hosts over 10 petabytes of satellite data across more than 3,000 webpages and data files, seamlessly accessible to end users. Our solution integrates both historic and cutting-edge systems: for example, we built custom data search and retrieval features that span an inventory of 2+ petabytes of NOAA satellite observations (from heritage sensors to the latest NOAA-20/VIIRS feeds) with a consistent interface adopting the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) style. We also ensured the new Drupal-based portal could interoperate with NOAA's broader IT ecosystem. The site connects with NOAA's six regional CoastWatch nodes and external tools via standard protocols - including GIS mapping APIs and an online spatial database for geospatial data - enabling users to discover and visualize data from diverse sources in one place. By leveraging flexible, modern frameworks (e.g. Drupal CMS with custom modules) alongside NOAA's legacy infrastructure, the CWOW portal now bridges older systems and emerging data streams without disrupting service. This integration capability was demonstrated when we incorporated 20+ distinct satellite datasets and over 1,000 oceanographic parameters into the portal (ranging from legacy NOAA satellites to new Sentinel and JAXA sensors), allowing researchers to access both historical and real-time data through a unified platform.
Scalability, Adaptability, and Resilience. The CoastWatch/OceanWatch environment engineered by RIVA is built for long-term scalability and robustness. We designed the architecture to handle dramatic growth in data volume and user traffic over time. For instance, the portal's backend was optimized to manage petabyte-scale data loads, supporting the addition of large new datasets (such as high-resolution ocean color imagery) without performance degradation. Our team implemented scalable data pipelines and processing workflows - developing three new data acquisition/distribution systems and an automated ocean-color processing engine - to accommodate expanding mission requirements and future satellites. We continuously adapt the platform to evolving technology: a notable example is our successful migration of a legacy NOAA scientific website into the Drupal CMS with minimal downtime, then enhancing it with modern features like dynamic data search, interactive mapping, and cloud-ready processing. We even partnered with NOAA on cloud pilot initiatives (AWS GovCloud) to offload computationally intensive tasks, demonstrating that the system can adapt to cloud infrastructure for improved efficiency. Throughout these enhancements, system resilience has been paramount. We employ CI/CD automation and rigorous testing (unit, integration, and performance tests) for every release, and we've added automated monitoring (synthetic user tests) to catch and resolve issues proactively. Thanks to these measures, the CoastWatch portal has not only handled a growing user and data load but also consistently outperformed reliability targets - as noted, maintaining 99%+ availability over 5 years. Importantly, the platform's design emphasizes fault-tolerance (regular backups, redundant storage and failover mechanisms), ensuring that it remains highly resilient against outages or data loss. This scalable and robust infrastructure supports the

Seamless Customer Experience. RIVA's approach places heavy emphasis on delivering a smooth, usercentric experience for both NOAA's internal stakeholders and the broader public users of the CoastWatch/OceanWatch portal. As an external-facing digital platform, the CWOW website is designed to be intuitive and accessible to non-technical users while still providing advanced tools for power users. We implemented a modern, responsive user interface guided by the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) to ensure a familiar and seamless experience across devices. The portal's look-and-feel aligns with federal web standards, and all features are fully 508-accessible (e.g. alternative text, keyboard navigation), so that users of all abilities can navigate the data easily. RIVA's team provides end-to-end user support: we manage an active helpdesk and have created extensive user guides, FAQs, and training materials. In fact, we have trained and supported over 25,000 CoastWatch users through workshops, webinars, and on-demand tutorials, ensuring they can effectively utilize the system's data analysis tools. Using digital analytics and user feedback loops, we continually improve the user experience. For example, we analyze portal usage patterns and conduct user satisfaction surveys; feedback from these is fed into our development backlog. This agile, user-driven enhancement process has yielded tangible improvements - such as reducing data product publication time from days to under an hour and refining the search interface based on user input. As a result, the CoastWatch/OceanWatch portal now offers a more seamless and engaging customer experience: users can find, explore, and download ocean data more easily, with faster load times and richer visualization features than prior systems. NOAA has recognized our commitment to customer experience with formal accolades: the CoastWatch team earned the 2022 NESDIS Collaboration Award for expanding portal functionality and improving user adoption and satisfaction. This achievement underscores how our focus on usability and responsiveness directly supports NOAA's mission by broadening the portal's reach and impact.
NRC Drupal (31310024A0002/31310024F0113). RIVA successfully replaced the NRC's legacy Kentico CMS with a modern Drupal-based platform without any service interruptions, ensuring continuity of operations for millions of public users. The team migrated ~40,000 HTML pages and 53,000 PDF files into Drupal on schedule, executing the cutover with zero downtime or rollback needed. The new NRC.gov went live in Sept 2025 as planned and now runs on a FedRAMP-Moderate cloud hosting environment (Acquia on AWS) with a global Akamai CDN, providing a highly available architecture (>99.9% uptime target) to maintain uninterrupted access to this highly visible federal website. Performance benchmarks were met or exceeded - e.g. the system supports 100+ concurrent content editors and delivers public pages in under 3 seconds through optimized caching and content delivery. This seamless migration preserved NRC's public communications mission without any loss of service continuity.
Integration of Legacy and Emerging Systems. The Drupal solution was engineered to integrate with a diverse portfolio of NRC's legacy systems while introducing new capabilities. RIVA developed custom modules and scripts to interface with NRC's existing repositories - for example, ingesting documents from the ADAMS database (Agencywide Documents Access and Management System) so that decades of regulatory records remain searchable on the new site. The team also connected Drupal's forms to NRC's Lyris email subscription service to maintain continuity of the agency's mailing list and feedback workflows. For internal users, the platform ties into NRC's enterprise identity management (ICAM/Active Directory), enabling single sign-on and role-based permissions for content editors as it did before. At the same time, the project leveraged emerging technologies - for instance, implementing headless Drupal techniques to support interactive data dashboards using open-source JavaScript frameworks. This means NRC can present dynamic visual content (e.g. reactor status dashboards) powered by Drupal's back-end data and modern front-end libraries. The end result is a flexible, interoperable system that bridges old and new: all critical legacy content and services are preserved, while the site is architected to incorporate modern tools and future integrations seamlessly.

Operating in a Secure, Regulated Federal Environment. RIVA's approach recognized NRC.gov's status as a highly regulated and high-profile government website, meeting strict federal standards for security, accessibility, and governance. The new Drupal platform adheres to all NRC security requirements and obtained a full Authority to Operate (ATO) prior to launch. Hosting is provided on Acquia's Government Cloud (FedRAMP Moderate), which inherently satisfies many federal compliance controls. The team worked closely with NRC's cybersecurity personnel to implement robust access controls (MFA, role-based rights) and to document security controls for the ATO package, achieving accreditation in under a year. Section 508 accessibility compliance was a major focus: early audits of the legacy site revealed numerous issues, all of which were remedied in the Drupal rebuild. The final site meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards across its pages, a significant improvement from the Kentico site. To ensure this, RIVA integrated automated accessibility scanning (axe-core/WAVE tools) and rigorous 508 testing into the QA process. The front-end was implemented using the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) templates and standards, guaranteeing a consistent federal look-and-feel and compliance with the 21st Century IDEA Act for digital services. Additionally, the solution complies with new OMB mandates (e.g. M-23-22 digital experience guidelines) by providing a mobile-responsive design, plain language content, and unified search across all content including PDFs. In sum, the NRC Drupal site is fully secure, accessible, and policy-compliant, operating under an approved governance framework in this highly scrutinized environment.
Long-Term Scalability, Adaptability, and User Experience. The delivered Drupal platform is built for scalable performance and long-term resilience. By leveraging a cloud-based containerized infrastructure (Acquia on AWS with multi-tier caching and Apache Solr search), the site can handle high traffic volumes and spikes without degradation. The architecture introduces redundancy and modern DevSecOps practices (infrastructure-as-code, continuous integration pipelines) that make the system robust against failures and easy to update or expand in the future. This means NRC's web presence can grow and adapt - new features or modules can be added via Drupal's modular framework, and the platform is interoperable with emerging technologies and APIs by design. Importantly, the modernization has also greatly improved the end-user experience on NRC.gov. The site now features a fully responsive design that works seamlessly on mobile devices and tablets (a key requirement that was validated during user testing). Page load times and search capabilities have been enhanced by the move to Drupal and Solr - users find information faster and more reliably than on the old site. The new interface design, guided by UX best practices and the USWDS style guide, offers a clean, intuitive navigation and consistent layout, making it easier for the public to access regulatory information and services. Early feedback from NRC stakeholders and public metrics indicate higher satisfaction due to these improvements, as content is not only more accessible but also kept up-todate through automated workflows and notifications. Scalability and adaptability are built-in: NRC now has a future-proof digital platform that can evolve (e.g. adding a blog, integrating new data APIs, or implementing enhanced online services) without a complete overhaul. In conclusion, the NRC Drupal migration project delivered a seamless customer experience and a robust, flexible web platform - one that maintains uninterrupted service to the public, integrates essential systems, upholds all federal requirements, and is engineered to scale and adapt to the agency's needs for years to come.

Integration of Legacy & Emerging Systems. PTACTS demonstrates superior systems integration capabilities. The platform interfaces with a diverse portfolio of USPTO legacy systems and new services, bridging old and modern technologies. For example, it integrates with USPTO's enterprise authentication (Okta single sign-on), fee payment portals, and data warehouses via secure RESTful APIs. Simultaneously, it exposes its own APIs to allow external USPTO applications (like Patent Center and analytics tools) to retrieve case data, enabling a two-way data flow across the USPTO ecosystem. The solution's modern microservice architecture is designed for compatibility with legacy components - the core case data remains on a legacy Oracle database (maintained for stability), but RIVA has encapsulated it with modern API layers so that future data stores or cloud services can be swapped in with minimal impact. This flexible, open architecture has allowed PTACTS to incorporate emerging technologies (e.g. containerization, event streaming) alongside legacy modules. As a result, the system can seamlessly connect disparate systems - from older PTAB data feeds to new cloud-based services - ensuring data continuity and functional integration across the agency's IT portfolio. All integrations are done in compliance with USPTO's stringent IT policies, proving our ability to modernize without disrupting legacy capabilities.
Scalability, Adaptability & Resilience. The PTACTS solution is architected with long-term scalability and resilience in mind. It is hosted in a secure AWS cloud environment using container orchestration (AWS ECS/EKS for Docker containers) and Infrastructure-as-Code automation. This cloud-native setup enables on-demand scaling of services and high availability across multiple environments (dev, test, production). As a result, PTACTS can easily handle rising workloads - currently supporting over 10,000 user sessions per month with ample headroom for growth - without performance degradation. The system's modular microservice design (Java Spring Boot back end and an Angular/TypeScript front end leveraging U.S. Web Design System for 508-compliant UI) provides adaptability for future needs. We can introduce new features or even new technology components (e.g. additional cloud services or updated frameworks) incrementally without rewriting the whole system. Our DevSecOps pipeline underpins this agility: all code is managed in Git and built/tested through automated CI/CD continuous delivery pipelines, enabling rapid yet reliable deployments. In fact, the team delivers 20-30 production deployments per month, accelerating improvements while maintaining stability. Robust automated testing (unit, integration, and 508 accessibility checks) and security scans (quality gates via SonarQube and SAST) are built into the pipeline to catch issues early, ensuring that frequent releases do not compromise quality. This modern, cloud-based and heavily automated approach has made PTACTS highly resilient (no major incidents, rapid recovery from minor issues) and positioned the system for easy scalability and evolution over the 5-year contract term and beyond.
Seamless Customer Experience. This past performance also highlights RIVA's focus on delivering a superior user experience for both internal PTAB staff and external filers. Under our management, PTACTS has introduced numerous user-centric enhancements that make the system more intuitive, efficient, and responsive. We streamlined formerly manual processes by deploying new digital features - for example, implementing an online module for filing Production Goal Adjustment requests, which eliminated a cumbersome paper-based workflow for patent attorneys and reduced offline requests to near-zero. We also delivered improvements for external users, such as more flexible electronic filing options and new submission types (e.g. support for additional rehearing request types), directly enhancing the external stakeholder experience. Internal users (judges, paralegals, staff) have benefited from an improved UI and faster performance: the modern single-page front end provides a responsive, 508-compliant interface with features like dynamic filtering of case dockets, and recent optimizations significantly sped up page load times for key screens. Thanks to iterative user feedback sessions and human-centered design practices, each release is aligned with user needs - evidenced by high adoption rates of new features across all user groups and minimal support issues post-deployment (virtually no critical defects escaping into production). Moreover, operating in a high-visibility environment like PTAB, we provide transparent communications (monthly status reports, demos, training for new features) which has earned strong customer satisfaction. The USPTO Product Owner and executives have commended the PTACTS team's work, noting the seamless continuity and meaningful enhancements delivered without disruption. Overall, the PTACTS past
